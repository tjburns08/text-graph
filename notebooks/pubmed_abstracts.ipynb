Construction of a low-dimensional model to effectively reduce the dimensionality of the imaging problem has recently shown great promise in improving these tradeoffs. This paper presents a new approach to model and reconstruct the spectroscopic signals by learning a nonlinear low-dimensional representation of the general MR spectra. Specifically, we trained a deep neural network to capture the low-dimensional manifold, where the high-dimensional spectroscopic signals reside. A regularization formulation is proposed to effectively integrate the learned model and physics-based data acquisition model for MRSI reconstruction with the capability to incorporate additional spatiospectral constraints. An efficient numerical algorithm was developed to solve the associated optimization problem involving back-propagating the trained network. Simulation and experimental results were obtained to demonstrate the representation power of the learned model and the ability of the proposed formulation in producing SNR-enhancing reconstruction from the practical MRSI data.'], 'Constrained Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopic Imaging by Learning Nonlinear Low-Dimensional Models.')</td>\n",

This was followed by the covalent binding of GOx to graphene-functionalized GCE using 1-ethyl-3-[3-dimethylaminopropyl]carbodiimide hydrochloride (EDC) based crosslinking. Graphene provided signal enhancement by providing greater surface area for GOx binding, while APTES-functionalization led to a higher GOx immobilization density by providing free amino groups for crosslinking.

There was no interference from endogenous electroactive substances and drug metabolites. The developed biosensor was further validated for detecting blood glucose in commercial artificial blood glucose linearity standards in the range 1.4-27.9 mM.

Both caused severe pneumonia killing 774 and 858 people with 8700 cases of confirmed infection for the former, and 2494 for the latter, causing significant economic losses. 8 years later, despite the MERS outbreak remaining in certain parts of the world, at the end of 2019, a new zoonotic coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) and responsible of coronavirus Disease (COVID-19), arose from Wuhan, Hubei Province, China. It spread rapidly and to date has killed 3,242 persons with more than 81,000 cases of infection in China and causing over 126,000 global cases and 5,414 deaths in 166 other countries around the world, especially Italy. SARS-CoV-2 would seem to have come from a bat, but the intermediate reservoir continues to be unknown. Nonetheless, as for SARS-CoV and MERS CoV, the Spillover effect linked to animal-human promiscuity, human activities including deforestation, illegal bush-trafficking and bushmeat, cannot be excluded. Recently, however, evidence of inter-human only transmission of SARS-CoV-2 has been accumulated and thus, the outbreak seems to be spreading by human-to-human transmission throughout a large part of the world.

I show how PPS representation is not only multisensory, but actually multisensory-motor, as the PPS system interacts with motor areas to trigger appropriate responses. The extent of PPS is not fixed, but it is shaped by experience, as PPS may encompass farther portions of space, once the individual has interacted with them, (e.g., with tools), or it contracts, if interactions are limited because of external constraints, body, or brain injury. Interactions between the individual and the environment are not only physical but may also be \"abstract\". Recent data show that PPS adapts as a consequence of technology-mediated or social interactions. Finally, I propose that besides low-level sensory-motor representations of the space around the different parts of the body, mediating body-objects interactions, the multisensory PPS system also underlies a general representation of the self as distinct from the environment and the others.

The rat parietal cortex can be subdivided into four distinct rostral-caudal and medial-lateral regions, which includes a zone previously characterized as secondary visual cortex. At present, very little is known regarding the relative connectivity of these parietal subdivisions. Thus, we set out to map the connectivity of the entire anterior-posterior and medial-lateral span of this region. To do this we used anterograde and retrograde tracers in conjunction with open source neuronal segmentation and tracer detection tools to generate whole brain connectivity maps of parietal inputs and outputs. Our present results show that inputs to the parietal cortex varied significantly along the medial-lateral, but not the rostral-caudal axis. Specifically, retrosplenial connectivity is greater medially, but connectivity with visual cortex, though generally sparse, is more significant laterally. Finally, based on connection density, the connectivity between parietal cortex and hippocampus is indirect and likely achieved largely via dysgranular retrosplenial cortex.

Construction of a low-dimensional model to effectively reduce the dimensionality of the imaging problem has recently shown great promise in improving these tradeoffs. This paper presents a new approach to model and reconstruct the spectroscopic signals by learning a nonlinear low-dimensional representation of the general MR spectra. Specifically, we trained a deep neural network to capture the low-dimensional manifold, where the high-dimensional spectroscopic signals reside. A regularization formulation is proposed to effectively integrate the learned model and physics-based data acquisition model for MRSI reconstruction with the capability to incorporate additional spatiospectral constraints. An efficient numerical algorithm was developed to solve the associated optimization problem involving back-propagating the trained network. Simulation and experimental results were obtained to demonstrate the representation power of the learned model and the ability of the proposed formulation in producing SNR-enhancing reconstruction from the practical MRSI data.'], 'Constrained Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopic Imaging by Learning Nonlinear Low-Dimensional Models.')   \n",

This limits their potential applications, e.g., in mobile devices. In this paper, we propose a lightweight pyramid networt (LPNet) for single-image deraining. Instead of designing a complex network structure, we use domain-specific knowledge to simplify the learning process. In particular, we find that by introducing the mature Gaussian-Laplacian image pyramid decomposition technology to the neural network, the learning problem at each pyramid level is greatly simplified and can be handled by a relatively shallow network with few parameters. We adopt recursive and residual network structures to build the proposed LPNet, which has less than 8K parameters while still achieving the state-of-the-art performance on rain removal. We also discuss the potential value of LPNet for other low- and high-level vision tasks.'], 'Lightweight Pyramid Networks for Image Deraining.')   \n",

However, due to the lack of dense annotation of large-scale chest radiograph data, this computer-aided diagnosis task is intrinsically a weakly supervised learning problem and remains challenging. In this paper, we propose a novel deep convolutional neural network called Thorax-Net to diagnose 14 thorax diseases using chest radiography. Thorax-Net consists of a classification branch and an attention branch. The classification branch serves as a uniform feature extraction-classification network to free users from the troublesome hand-crafted feature extraction and classifier construction. The attention branch exploits the correlation between class labels and the locations of pathological abnormalities via analyzing the feature maps learned by the classification branch. Feeding a chest radiograph to the trained Thorax-Net, a diagnosis is obtained by averaging and binarizing the outputs of two branches. The proposed Thorax-Net model has been evaluated against three state-of-the-art deep learning models using the patientwise official split of the ChestX-ray14 dataset and against other five deep learning models using the imagewise random data split. Our results show that Thorax-Net achieves an average per-class area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.7876 and 0.896 in both experiments, respectively, which are higher than the AUC values obtained by other deep models when they were all trained with no external data.'], 'Thorax-Net: An Attention Regularized Deep Neural Network for Classification of Thoracic Diseases on Chest Radiography.')   \n",

The prediction of drug interactions often relies on similarity metrics, assuming that drugs with similar structures or targets will have comparable behavior or may interfere with each other.

This important role has recently been extended, first to other forms of vocal learning in animals and then also to other forms of motor learning. The homology in structure and in function among the FoxP gene members raises the possibility that the ancestral FoxP gene may have evolved as a crucial component of the neural circuitry mediating motor learning. Here we report that genetic manipulations of the single Drosophila orthologue, dFoxP, disrupt operant self-learning, a form of motor learning sharing several conceptually analogous features with language acquisition. Structural alterations of the dFoxP locus uncovered the role of dFoxP in operant self-learning and habit formation, as well as the dispensability of dFoxP for operant world-learning, in which no motor learning occurs. These manipulations also led to subtle alterations in the brain anatomy, including a reduced volume of the optic glomeruli. RNAi-mediated interference with dFoxP expression levels copied the behavioral phenotype of the mutant flies, even in the absence of mRNA degradation. Our results provide evidence that motor learning and language acquisition share a common ancestral trait still present in extant invertebrates, manifest in operant self-learning. This 'deep' homology probably traces back to before the split between vertebrate and invertebrate animals.\"], 'Drosophila FoxP mutants are deficient in operant self-learning.')   \n",

Eyeblink conditioning has been used for decades a model system for elucidating cerebellar learning mechanisms. The standard model of the mechanisms underlying eyeblink conditioning is that there two synaptic plasticity processes within the cerebellum that are necessary for acquisition of the conditioned response: (1) long-term depression (LTD) at parallel fiber-Purkinje cell synapses and (2) long-term potentiation (LTP) at mossy fiber-interpositus nucleus synapses. Additional Purkinje cell plasticity mechanisms may also contribute to eyeblink conditioning including LTP, excitability, and entrainment of deep nucleus activity. Recent analyses of the sensory input pathways necessary for eyeblink conditioning indicate that the cerebellum regulates its inputs to facilitate learning and maintain plasticity. Cerebellar learning during eyeblink conditioning is therefore a dynamic interactive process which maximizes responding to significant stimuli and suppresses responding to irrelevant or redundant stimuli.

Present study explores the ameliorative effect of withanolide A, a major component of withania root extract and its molecular mechanism against hypoxia induced memory impairment. Withanolide A was administered to male Sprague Dawley rats before a period of 21 days pre-exposure and during 07 days of exposure to a simulated altitude of 25,000 ft. Glutathione level and glutathione dependent free radicals scavenging enzyme system, ATP, NADPH level, γ-glutamylcysteinyl ligase (GCLC) activity and oxidative stress markers were assessed in the hippocampus. Expression of apoptotic marker caspase 3 in hippocampus was investigated by immunohistochemistry. Transcriptional alteration and expression of GCLC and Nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-related factor 2 (Nrf2) were investigated by real time PCR and immunoblotting respectively. Exposure to hypobaric hypoxia decreased reduced glutathione (GSH) level and impaired reduced gluatathione dependent free radical scavenging system in hippocampus resulting in elevated oxidative stress. Supplementation of withanolide A during hypoxic exposure increased GSH level, augmented GSH dependent free radicals scavenging system and decreased the number of caspase and hoescht positive cells in hippocampus. While withanolide A reversed hypoxia mediated neurodegeneration, administration of buthionine sulfoximine along with withanolide A blunted its neuroprotective effects. Exogenous administration of corticosterone suppressed Nrf2 and GCLC expression whereas inhibition of corticosterone synthesis upregulated Nrf2 as well as GCLC. Thus present study infers that withanolide A reduces neurodegeneration by restoring hypoxia induced glutathione depletion in hippocampus. Further, Withanolide A increases glutathione biosynthesis in neuronal cells by upregulating GCLC level through Nrf2 pathway in a corticosterone dependenet manner.'], 'Withanolide A prevents neurodegeneration by modulating hippocampal glutathione biosynthesis during hypoxia.')   \n",

To provide evidence for the effectiveness of DBS as a treatment for dementia, we performed DBS in a rat model of dementia with intracerebroventricular administration of 192\\u2009IgG-saporins. We utilized four groups of rats, group 1, unlesioned control; group 2, cholinergic lesion; group 3, cholinergic lesion plus medial septum (MS) electrode implantation (sham stimulation); group 4, cholinergic lesions plus MS electrode implantation and stimulation. During the probe test in the water maze, performance of the lesion group decreased for measures of time spent and the number of swim crossings over the previous platform location. Interestingly, the stimulation group showed an equivalent performance to the normal group on all measures. And these are partially reversed by the electrode implantation. Acetylcholinesterase activity in the hippocampus was decreased in lesion and implantation groups, whereas activity in the stimulation group was not different from the normal group. Hippocampal neurogenesis was increased in the stimulation group. Our results revealed that DBS of MS restores spatial memory after damage to cholinergic neurons.

       "3      (['18 years ago, in 2002, the world was astonished by the appearance of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), supported by a zoonotic coronavirus, called SARS-CoV, from the Guangdong Province of southern China. After about 10 years, in 2012, another similar coronavirus triggered the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV) in Saudi Arabia. Both caused severe pneumonia killing 774 and 858 people with 8700 cases of confirmed infection for the former, and 2494 for the latter, causing significant economic losses. 8 years later, despite the MERS outbreak remaining in certain parts of the world, at the end of 2019, a new zoonotic coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) and responsible of coronavirus Disease (COVID-19), arose from Wuhan, Hubei Province, China. It spread rapidly and to date has killed 3,242 persons with more than 81,000 cases of infection in China and causing over 126,000 global cases and 5,414 deaths in 166 other countries around the world, especially Italy. SARS-CoV-2 would seem to have come from a bat, but the intermediate reservoir continues to be unknown. Nonetheless, as for SARS-CoV and MERS CoV, the Spillover effect linked to animal-human promiscuity, human activities including deforestation, illegal bush-trafficking and bushmeat, cannot be excluded. Recently, however, evidence of inter-human only transmission of SARS-CoV-2 has been accumulated and thus, the outbreak seems to be spreading by human-to-human transmission throughout a large part of the world.

Here, by developing novel sparse representation of whole-brain fMRI signals and by using the recently publicly released large-scale Human Connectome Project high-quality fMRI data, we show that a number of reproducible and robust functional networks, including both task-evoked and resting state networks, are simultaneously distributed in distant neuroanatomic areas and substantially spatially overlapping with each other, thus forming an initial collection of holistic atlases of functional networks and interactions (HAFNIs). More interestingly, the HAFNIs revealed two distinct patterns of highly overlapped regions and highly specialized regions and exhibited that these two patterns of areas are reciprocally localized, revealing a novel organizational principle of cortical function.'], 'Holistic atlases of functional networks and interactions reveal reciprocal organizational architecture of cortical function.')   \n",

Rats were implanted with CPEs in two nodes of the default mode network (DMN) and two nodes in a lateral cortical network, revealing amperometric oxygen correlation patterns consistent with imaging studies. Using a block design study where rats alternated between sustained periods of instrumental response and unscheduled spontaneous behavior, task-induced decreases in functional connectivity were observed between the DMN node pair, but not in the distinct lateral cortical network, demonstrating network-specific modulation of functional connectivity.'], 'Task-induced modulation of intrinsic functional connectivity networks in the behaving rat.')   \n",

       "4      (['A central feature of theories of spatial navigation involves the representation of spatial relationships between objects in complex environments. The parietal cortex has long been linked to the processing of spatial visual information and recent evidence from single unit recording in rodents suggests a role for this region in encoding egocentric and world-centered frames. The rat parietal cortex can be subdivided into four distinct rostral-caudal and medial-lateral regions, which includes a zone previously characterized as secondary visual cortex. At present, very little is known regarding the relative connectivity of these parietal subdivisions. Thus, we set out to map the connectivity of the entire anterior-posterior and medial-lateral span of this region. To do this we used anterograde and retrograde tracers in conjunction with open source neuronal segmentation and tracer detection tools to generate whole brain connectivity maps of parietal inputs and outputs. Our present results show that inputs to the parietal cortex varied significantly along the medial-lateral, but not the rostral-caudal axis. Specifically, retrosplenial connectivity is greater medially, but connectivity with visual cortex, though generally sparse, is more significant laterally. Finally, based on connection density, the connectivity between parietal cortex and hippocampus is indirect and likely achieved largely via dysgranular retrosplenial cortex. Thus, similar to primates, the parietal cortex of rats exhibits a difference in connectivity along the medial-lateral axis, which may represent functionally distinct areas.'], 'Cortical connectivity maps reveal anatomically distinct areas in the parietal cortex of the rat.')   \n",

       "2      ([\"Early exposure to radiological cross-section images during introductory anatomy and dissection courses increases students' understanding of both anatomy and radiology. Novel technologies such as augmented reality (AR) offer unique advantages for an interactive and hands-on integration with the student at the center of the learning experience. In this article, the benefits of a previously proposed AR Magic Mirror system are compared to the Anatomage, a virtual dissection table as a system for combined anatomy and radiology teaching during a two-semester gross anatomy course with 749 first-year medical students, as well as a follow-up elective course with 72 students. During the former, students worked with both systems in dedicated tutorial sessions which accompanied the anatomy lectures and provided survey-based feedback. In the elective course, participants were assigned to three groups and underwent a self-directed learning session using either Anatomage, Magic Mirror, or traditional radiology atlases. A pre- and posttest design with multiple choice questions revealed significant improvements in test scores between the two tests for both the Magic Mirror and the group using radiology atlases, while no significant differences in test scores were recorded for the Anatomage group. Furthermore, especially students with low mental rotation test (MRT) scores benefited from the Magic Mirror and Anatomage and achieved significantly higher posttest scores compared to students with a low MRT score in the theory group. Overall, the results provide supporting evidence that the Magic Mirror system achieves comparable results in terms of learning outcome to established anatomy learning tools such as Anatomage and radiology atlases.\"], 'The Benefits of an Augmented Reality Magic Mirror System for Integrated Radiology Teaching in Gross Anatomy.')   \n",

Invasive systems achieve a high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) by eliminating the volume conduction problems caused by tissue and bone. An implantable brain machine interface (BMI) using intracortical electrodes provides excellent detection of a broad range of frequency oscillatory activities through the placement of a sensor in direct contact with cortex. This paper introduces a compact-sized implantable wireless 32-channel bidirectional brain machine interface (BBMI) to be used with freely-moving primates. The system is designed to monitor brain sensorimotor rhythms and present current stimuli with a configurable duration, frequency and amplitude in real time to the brain based on the brain activity report. The battery is charged via a novel ultrasonic wireless power delivery module developed for efficient delivery of power into a deeply-implanted system. The system was successfully tested through bench tests and in vivo tests on a behaving primate to record the local field potential (LFP) oscillation and stimulate the target area at the same time.'], 'A Wireless 32-Channel Implantable Bidirectional Brain Machine Interface.')   \n",
       "1      (['Independent component analysis (ICA) as a promising spatial filtering method can separate motor-related independent components (MRICs) from the multichannel electroencephalogram (EEG) signals. However, the unpredictable burst interferences may significantly degrade the performance of ICA-based brain-computer interface (BCI) system. In this study, we proposed a new algorithm frame to address this issue by combining the single-trial-based ICA filter with zero-training classifier. We developed a two-round data selection method to identify automatically the badly corrupted EEG trials in the training set. The \"high quality\" training trials were utilized to optimize the ICA filter. In addition, we proposed an accuracy-matrix method to locate the artifact data segments within a single trial and investigated which types of artifacts can influence the performance of the ICA-based MIBCIs. Twenty-six EEG datasets of three-class motor imagery were used to validate the proposed methods, and the classification accuracies were compared with that obtained by frequently used common spatial pattern (CSP) spatial filtering algorithm. The experimental results demonstrated that the proposed optimizing strategy could effectively improve the stability, practicality and classification performance of ICA-based MIBCI. The study revealed that rational use of ICA method may be crucial in building a practical ICA-based MIBCI system.'], 'A Fully Automated Trial Selection Method for Optimization of Motor Imagery Based Brain-Computer Interface.')   \n",

Patients diagnosed as in a vegetative state lack awareness, while patients diagnosed as in a minimally conscious state retain fluctuating awareness. However, it is a challenge to accurately diagnose these disorders with clinical assessments of behavior. To improve diagnostic accuracy, neuroimaging-based approaches have been developed to detect the presence or absence of awareness in patients who lack overt responsiveness. For the small subset of patients who retain awareness, brain-computer interfaces could serve as tools for communication and environmental control. Here we review the existing literature concerning the sensory and cognitive abilities of patients with disorders of consciousness with respect to existing brain-computer interface designs.

The surface of GCE was functionalized with graphene by incubating it with graphene dispersed in 3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane (APTES), which acted both as a dispersion agent for graphene and as an amine surface modification agent for GCE and graphene. This was followed by the covalent binding of GOx to graphene-functionalized GCE using 1-ethyl-3-[3-dimethylaminopropyl]carbodiimide hydrochloride (EDC) based crosslinking. Graphene provided signal enhancement by providing greater surface area for GOx binding, while APTES-functionalization led to a higher GOx immobilization density by providing free amino groups for crosslinking. The developed biosensor used a redox potential of -0.45 V (vs. Ag/AgCl) for detecting glucose in the diabetic pathophysiological range 0.5-32 mM. There was no interference from endogenous electroactive substances and drug metabolites. The developed biosensor was further validated for detecting blood glucose in commercial artificial blood glucose linearity standards in the range 1.4-27.9 mM. Therefore, it is ideal for diabetic blood glucose monitoring. The developed bioanalytical procedure for preparation of GOx-bound graphene-functionalized GCEs had high production reproducibility and high storage stability, which is appropriate for the commercial mass production of enzyme-bound electrodes.'], 'Mediatorless amperometric glucose biosensing using 3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane-functionalized graphene.')   \n",

Here, we report the integrative assembly of chemically modified graphene (CMG) building blocks into hierarchical complex structures with the hybrid composition for high performance flexible pseudocapacitors. The formation mechanism of hierarchical CMG/Nafion/RuO2 (CMGNR) microspheres, which is triggered by the cooperative interplay during the in situ synthesis of RuO2 nanoparticles (NPs), was extensively investigated. In particular, the hierarchical CMGNR microspheres consisting of the aggregates of CMG/Nafion (CMGN) nanosheets and RuO2 NPs provided large surface area and facile ion accessibility to storage sites, while the interconnected nanosheets offered continuous electron pathways and mechanical integrity. The synergistic effect of CMGNR hybrids on the supercapacitor (SC) performance was derived from the hybrid composition of pseudocapacitive RuO2 NPs with the conductive CMGNs as well as from structural features. Consequently, the CMGNR-SCs showed a specific capacitance as high as 160 F g(-1), three-fold higher than that of conventional graphene SCs, and a capacitance retention of >95% of the maximum value even after severe bending and 1000 charge-discharge tests due to the structural and compositional features.'], 'Electroactive nanoparticle directed assembly of functionalized graphene nanosheets into hierarchical structures with hybrid compositions for flexible supercapacitors.')   \n",

Voltammetry and fluorescence spectroscopy were used to obtain the analytical profiles from different reactant mixtures as a function of concentration. This enabled the extraction of the equilibrium constants (K(SV)) which are reported for the first time. Voltammetric results supported the formation of the LD-BSA complex but not that with dopamine. Further information of the LD-BSA system was unattainable because the measured composite profiles could not be extracted. New information was obtained when the extended data matrix was resolved by the MCR-ALS method. The previously unavailable extracted voltammogram profile of LD-BSA complex indicated that the complex was electroactive; this was unexpected if the LD-BSA system was in its folded state, and hence, it was suggested that the protein must be unfolded. The observation that the drug:BSA stoichiometry was 3:1, i.e. (levodopa)(3)-BSA, supported this suggestion; these results were obtained from the MCR-ALS extracted concentration profiles for the three reaction components.'], 'Combined voltammetric and spectroscopic analysis of small molecule-biopolymer interactions: the levodopa and serum albumin system.')   \n",

Atomic force microscopy (AFM) imaging showed significant reduction of biofilm growth on PVK-SWNT coated surfaces.

Here, we developed this technique to build up multilayers of functionalized carbon nanotubes on the basis of both intermolecular electrostatic and coordinative interactions. Positively charged electroactive viologenthiol (VSH) was first immobilized on multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWNTs) to form MWNT-VSH hybrids with a relative content of ∼9% by weight. Field emission transmission electron microscopy images revealed that the VSH molecules randomly covered the surfaces of MWNTs with a thickness of 1 to 2 nm. Then, the MWNT-VSH hybrids were used as nanoscale multidentate \"ligands\" (linkers) to construct metal-mediated multilayers with the use of CuAc(2) as the connectors by the layer-by-layer (LBL) method. The assembly process was monitored by absorption and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy as well as scanning electron and atomic force microscopy after each assembly of Cu(II) ions and MWNT-VSH hybrids. Finally, the electrochemical behaviors of the viologens in the MWNT-VS/Cu LBL multilayers were investigated.'], 'Copper(II)-mediated layer-by-layer assembly of viologenthiol-functionalized carbon nanotube hybrid multilayers: preparation, characterization, morphology, and electrochemical properties.')   \n",

To minimize tissue damage while retaining high sensitivity, a flexible and a smaller electrode with low impedance is required. However, it is a major challenge to reduce electrode size while retaining the conductive characteristics of the electrode. In addition, the mechanical mismatch between stiff electrodes and soft tissues creates damaging reactive tissue responses. Here, we demonstrate a neural probe structure based on graphene, ZnO nanowires, and conducting polymer that provides flexibility and low impedance performance. A hybrid Au and graphene structure was utilized to achieve both flexibility and good conductivity. Using ZnO nanowires to increase the effective surface area drastically decreased the impedance value and enhanced the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR).

The detailed capture/release behavior of the circulating tumor cells was studied using an organic bioelectronic platform comprising PEO/PEDOT:PSS nanofiber mats with 3 wt % (3-glycidyloxypropyl)trimethoxysilane as an additive. We have demonstrated that these nanofiber mats deposited on five-patterned indium tin oxide finger electrodes are excellent candidates for use as functional bioelectronic interfaces for the isolation, detection, sequential collection, and enrichment of rare CTCs through electrical activation of each single electrode. This combination behaved as an ideal model system displaying a high cell-capture yield for antibody-positive cells while resisting the adhesion of antibody-negative cells. Taking advantage of the electrochemical doping/dedoping characteristics of PEDOT:PSS materials, the captured rare cells could be electrically triggered release through the desorption phenomena of PLL-g-PEG-biotin on device surface. More than 90% of the targeted cancer cells were captured on the 3D PEDOT-based nanofiber microfluidic device; over 87% of captured cancer cells were subsequently released for collection; approximately 80% of spiked cancer cells could be collected in a 96-well plate.

The MOF-525 serves as an electrocatalytic surface, while the PEDOT NTs act as a charge collector to rapidly transport the electron from MOF nanocrystals. Bundles of these particles form a conductive interpenetrating network film that together: (i) improves charge transport pathways between the MOF-525 regions and (ii) increases the electrochemical active sites of the film. The electrocatalytic response is measured by cyclic voltammetry and differential pulse voltammetry techniques, where the linear concentration range of DA detection is estimated to be 2 × 10-6-270 × 10-6 m and the detection limit is estimated to be 0.04 × 10-6 m with high selectivity toward DA. Additionally, a real-time determination of DA released from living rat pheochromocytoma cells is realized.

Beyond homeostatic regulation and sensing, recent neuroscience research has started to shed light on brain-heart interactions in diverse cognitive and emotional processes. In particular, neural responses to heartbeats, as measured with the so-called heartbeat-evoked potential, have been shown to be useful for investigating cortical activity processing cardiac signals. In this review, we first overview and discuss the basic properties of the HEP such as underlying physiological pathways, brain regions, and neural mechanisms. We then provide a systematic review of the mental processes associated with cortical HEP activations, notably heartbeat perception, emotional feelings, perceptual awareness, and self-consciousness, in healthy subjects and clinical populations. Finally, we discuss methodological issues regarding the experimental design and data analysis for separating genuine HEP components from physiological artifacts (e.g., cardiac field artifact, pulse artifact) or other neural activities that are not specifically associated with the heartbeat. Findings from this review suggest that when intrinsic limitations (e.g., artifacts) are carefully controlled, the HEP could provide a reliable neural measure for investigating brain-viscera interactions in diverse mental processes.'], 'Heartbeat-evoked cortical responses: Underlying mechanisms, functional roles, and methodological considerations.')   \n",

The APO was setup either to assist volunteers at the hip levels during balance loss or to be transparent. The Planar Covariation Law (PCL) of the lower limb elevation angles was the main tool used to assess the intersegmental coordination of both limbs (i.e., the perturbed and unperturbed ones). Results revealed that, after the onset of the perturbation, elevation angles of both limbs do not covary, a part from the robot-mediated assistance.

       "3      (['Our brain has developed a specific system to represent the space closely surrounding the body, termed peripersonal space (PPS). This space has a key functional role as it is where all physical interactions with objects in the environment occur. Here I describe how multisensory neurons in a specific fronto-parietal network map the PPS by integrating tactile stimuli on the body with visual or auditory information related to external objects specifically when they are close to the body. I show how PPS representation is not only multisensory, but actually multisensory-motor, as the PPS system interacts with motor areas to trigger appropriate responses. The extent of PPS is not fixed, but it is shaped by experience, as PPS may encompass farther portions of space, once the individual has interacted with them, (e.g., with tools), or it contracts, if interactions are limited because of external constraints, body, or brain injury. Interactions between the individual and the environment are not only physical but may also be \"abstract\". Recent data show that PPS adapts as a consequence of technology-mediated or social interactions. Finally, I propose that besides low-level sensory-motor representations of the space around the different parts of the body, mediating body-objects interactions, the multisensory PPS system also underlies a general representation of the self as distinct from the environment and the others. PPS thus supports self-location, contributes to bodily self-consciousness and mediates higher-level cognitive functions.'], 'Peripersonal space (PPS) as a multisensory interface between the individual and the environment, defining the space of the self.')   \n",

Here, we demonstrate how the intrinsic analogue programmability of memristive devices can be exploited to perform spike-sorting on single devices.

Construction of a low-dimensional model to effectively reduce the dimensionality of the imaging problem has recently shown great promise in improving these tradeoffs. This paper presents a new approach to model and reconstruct the spectroscopic signals by learning a nonlinear low-dimensional representation of the general MR spectra. Specifically, we trained a deep neural network to capture the low-dimensional manifold, where the high-dimensional spectroscopic signals reside. A regularization formulation is proposed to effectively integrate the learned model and physics-based data acquisition model for MRSI reconstruction with the capability to incorporate additional spatiospectral constraints. An efficient numerical algorithm was developed to solve the associated optimization problem involving back-propagating the trained network. Simulation and experimental results were obtained to demonstrate the representation power of the learned model and the ability of the proposed formulation in producing SNR-enhancing reconstruction from the practical MRSI data.'], 'Constrained Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopic Imaging by Learning Nonlinear Low-Dimensional Models.')</td>\n",

Instead of designing a complex network structure, we use domain-specific knowledge to simplify the learning process. In particular, we find that by introducing the mature Gaussian-Laplacian image pyramid decomposition technology to the neural network, the learning problem at each pyramid level is greatly simplified and can be handled by a relatively shallow network with few parameters. We adopt recursive and residual network structures to build the proposed LPNet, which has less than 8K parameters while still achieving the state-of-the-art performance on rain removal.

However, due to the lack of dense annotation of large-scale chest radiograph data, this computer-aided diagnosis task is intrinsically a weakly supervised learning problem and remains challenging. In this paper, we propose a novel deep convolutional neural network called Thorax-Net to diagnose 14 thorax diseases using chest radiography. Thorax-Net consists of a classification branch and an attention branch. The classification branch serves as a uniform feature extraction-classification network to free users from the troublesome hand-crafted feature extraction and classifier construction. The attention branch exploits the correlation between class labels and the locations of pathological abnormalities via analyzing the feature maps learned by the classification branch. Feeding a chest radiograph to the trained Thorax-Net, a diagnosis is obtained by averaging and binarizing the outputs of two branches. The proposed Thorax-Net model has been evaluated against three state-of-the-art deep learning models using the patientwise official split of the ChestX-ray14 dataset and against other five deep learning models using the imagewise random data split. Our results show that Thorax-Net achieves an average per-class area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.7876 and 0.896 in both experiments, respectively, which are higher than the AUC values obtained by other deep models when they were all trained with no external data.'], 'Thorax-Net: An Attention Regularized Deep Neural Network for Classification of Thoracic Diseases on Chest Radiography.')</td>\n",

Selection of the best drug(s) for a patient typically requires the integration of patient data, such as genetics or proteomics, with drug data, like compound chemical descriptors, to score the therapeutic efficacy of drugs. The prediction of drug interactions often relies on similarity metrics, assuming that drugs with similar structures or targets will have comparable behavior or may interfere with each other.

This important role has recently been extended, first to other forms of vocal learning in animals and then also to other forms of motor learning. The homology in structure and in function among the FoxP gene members raises the possibility that the ancestral FoxP gene may have evolved as a crucial component of the neural circuitry mediating motor learning. Here we report that genetic manipulations of the single Drosophila orthologue, dFoxP, disrupt operant self-learning, a form of motor learning sharing several conceptually analogous features with language acquisition. Structural alterations of the dFoxP locus uncovered the role of dFoxP in operant self-learning and habit formation, as well as the dispensability of dFoxP for operant world-learning, in which no motor learning occurs. These manipulations also led to subtle alterations in the brain anatomy, including a reduced volume of the optic glomeruli. RNAi-mediated interference with dFoxP expression levels copied the behavioral phenotype of the mutant flies, even in the absence of mRNA degradation. Our results provide evidence that motor learning and language acquisition share a common ancestral trait still present in extant invertebrates, manifest in operant self-learning.

Eyeblink conditioning has been used for decades a model system for elucidating cerebellar learning mechanisms. The standard model of the mechanisms underlying eyeblink conditioning is that there two synaptic plasticity processes within the cerebellum that are necessary for acquisition of the conditioned response: (1) long-term depression (LTD) at parallel fiber-Purkinje cell synapses and (2) long-term potentiation (LTP) at mossy fiber-interpositus nucleus synapses. Additional Purkinje cell plasticity mechanisms may also contribute to eyeblink conditioning including LTP, excitability, and entrainment of deep nucleus activity. Recent analyses of the sensory input pathways necessary for eyeblink conditioning indicate that the cerebellum regulates its inputs to facilitate learning and maintain plasticity. Cerebellar learning during eyeblink conditioning is therefore a dynamic interactive process which maximizes responding to significant stimuli and suppresses responding to irrelevant or redundant stimuli.

Glutathione level and glutathione dependent free radicals scavenging enzyme system, ATP, NADPH level, γ-glutamylcysteinyl ligase (GCLC) activity and oxidative stress markers were assessed in the hippocampus. Expression of apoptotic marker caspase 3 in hippocampus was investigated by immunohistochemistry. Transcriptional alteration and expression of GCLC and Nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-related factor 2 (Nrf2) were investigated by real time PCR and immunoblotting respectively. Exposure to hypobaric hypoxia decreased reduced glutathione (GSH) level and impaired reduced gluatathione dependent free radical scavenging system in hippocampus resulting in elevated oxidative stress. Supplementation of withanolide A during hypoxic exposure increased GSH level, augmented GSH dependent free radicals scavenging system and decreased the number of caspase and hoescht positive cells in hippocampus. While withanolide A reversed hypoxia mediated neurodegeneration, administration of buthionine sulfoximine along with withanolide A blunted its neuroprotective effects. Exogenous administration of corticosterone suppressed Nrf2 and GCLC expression whereas inhibition of corticosterone synthesis upregulated Nrf2 as well as GCLC. Thus present study infers that withanolide A reduces neurodegeneration by restoring hypoxia induced glutathione depletion in hippocampus.

Interestingly, the stimulation group showed an equivalent performance to the normal group on all measures. And these are partially reversed by the electrode implantation.

Construction of a low-dimensional model to effectively reduce the dimensionality of the imaging problem has recently shown great promise in improving these tradeoffs. This paper presents a new approach to model and reconstruct the spectroscopic signals by learning a nonlinear low-dimensional representation of the general MR spectra. Specifically, we trained a deep neural network to capture the low-dimensional manifold, where the high-dimensional spectroscopic signals reside. A regularization formulation is proposed to effectively integrate the learned model and physics-based data acquisition model for MRSI reconstruction with the capability to incorporate additional spatiospectral constraints. An efficient numerical algorithm was developed to solve the associated optimization problem involving back-propagating the trained network. Simulation and experimental results were obtained to demonstrate the representation power of the learned model and the ability of the proposed formulation in producing SNR-enhancing reconstruction from the practical MRSI data.'], 'Constrained Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopic Imaging by Learning Nonlinear Low-Dimensional Models.')   \n",

This limits their potential applications, e.g., in mobile devices. In this paper, we propose a lightweight pyramid networt (LPNet) for single-image deraining. Instead of designing a complex network structure, we use domain-specific knowledge to simplify the learning process. In particular, we find that by introducing the mature Gaussian-Laplacian image pyramid decomposition technology to the neural network, the learning problem at each pyramid level is greatly simplified and can be handled by a relatively shallow network with few parameters. We adopt recursive and residual network structures to build the proposed LPNet, which has less than 8K parameters while still achieving the state-of-the-art performance on rain removal. We also discuss the potential value of LPNet for other low- and high-level vision tasks.'], 'Lightweight Pyramid Networks for Image Deraining.')   \n",

However, due to the lack of dense annotation of large-scale chest radiograph data, this computer-aided diagnosis task is intrinsically a weakly supervised learning problem and remains challenging. In this paper, we propose a novel deep convolutional neural network called Thorax-Net to diagnose 14 thorax diseases using chest radiography. Thorax-Net consists of a classification branch and an attention branch. The classification branch serves as a uniform feature extraction-classification network to free users from the troublesome hand-crafted feature extraction and classifier construction. The attention branch exploits the correlation between class labels and the locations of pathological abnormalities via analyzing the feature maps learned by the classification branch. Feeding a chest radiograph to the trained Thorax-Net, a diagnosis is obtained by averaging and binarizing the outputs of two branches. The proposed Thorax-Net model has been evaluated against three state-of-the-art deep learning models using the patientwise official split of the ChestX-ray14 dataset and against other five deep learning models using the imagewise random data split. Our results show that Thorax-Net achieves an average per-class area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.7876 and 0.896 in both experiments, respectively, which are higher than the AUC values obtained by other deep models when they were all trained with no external data.'], 'Thorax-Net: An Attention Regularized Deep Neural Network for Classification of Thoracic Diseases on Chest Radiography.')   \n",

The prediction of drug interactions often relies on similarity metrics, assuming that drugs with similar structures or targets will have comparable behavior or may interfere with each other.

This important role has recently been extended, first to other forms of vocal learning in animals and then also to other forms of motor learning. The homology in structure and in function among the FoxP gene members raises the possibility that the ancestral FoxP gene may have evolved as a crucial component of the neural circuitry mediating motor learning. Here we report that genetic manipulations of the single Drosophila orthologue, dFoxP, disrupt operant self-learning, a form of motor learning sharing several conceptually analogous features with language acquisition. Structural alterations of the dFoxP locus uncovered the role of dFoxP in operant self-learning and habit formation, as well as the dispensability of dFoxP for operant world-learning, in which no motor learning occurs. These manipulations also led to subtle alterations in the brain anatomy, including a reduced volume of the optic glomeruli. RNAi-mediated interference with dFoxP expression levels copied the behavioral phenotype of the mutant flies, even in the absence of mRNA degradation. Our results provide evidence that motor learning and language acquisition share a common ancestral trait still present in extant invertebrates, manifest in operant self-learning. This 'deep' homology probably traces back to before the split between vertebrate and invertebrate animals.\"], 'Drosophila FoxP mutants are deficient in operant self-learning.')   \n",

Eyeblink conditioning has been used for decades a model system for elucidating cerebellar learning mechanisms. The standard model of the mechanisms underlying eyeblink conditioning is that there two synaptic plasticity processes within the cerebellum that are necessary for acquisition of the conditioned response: (1) long-term depression (LTD) at parallel fiber-Purkinje cell synapses and (2) long-term potentiation (LTP) at mossy fiber-interpositus nucleus synapses. Additional Purkinje cell plasticity mechanisms may also contribute to eyeblink conditioning including LTP, excitability, and entrainment of deep nucleus activity. Recent analyses of the sensory input pathways necessary for eyeblink conditioning indicate that the cerebellum regulates its inputs to facilitate learning and maintain plasticity. Cerebellar learning during eyeblink conditioning is therefore a dynamic interactive process which maximizes responding to significant stimuli and suppresses responding to irrelevant or redundant stimuli.

       "13198  (['Withania somnifera root extract has been used traditionally in ayurvedic system of medicine as a memory enhancer. Present study explores the ameliorative effect of withanolide A, a major component of withania root extract and its molecular mechanism against hypoxia induced memory impairment. Withanolide A was administered to male Sprague Dawley rats before a period of 21 days pre-exposure and during 07 days of exposure to a simulated altitude of 25,000 ft. Glutathione level and glutathione dependent free radicals scavenging enzyme system, ATP, NADPH level, γ-glutamylcysteinyl ligase (GCLC) activity and oxidative stress markers were assessed in the hippocampus. Expression of apoptotic marker caspase 3 in hippocampus was investigated by immunohistochemistry. Transcriptional alteration and expression of GCLC and Nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-related factor 2 (Nrf2) were investigated by real time PCR and immunoblotting respectively. Exposure to hypobaric hypoxia decreased reduced glutathione (GSH) level and impaired reduced gluatathione dependent free radical scavenging system in hippocampus resulting in elevated oxidative stress. Supplementation of withanolide A during hypoxic exposure increased GSH level, augmented GSH dependent free radicals scavenging system and decreased the number of caspase and hoescht positive cells in hippocampus. While withanolide A reversed hypoxia mediated neurodegeneration, administration of buthionine sulfoximine along with withanolide A blunted its neuroprotective effects. Exogenous administration of corticosterone suppressed Nrf2 and GCLC expression whereas inhibition of corticosterone synthesis upregulated Nrf2 as well as GCLC. Thus present study infers that withanolide A reduces neurodegeneration by restoring hypoxia induced glutathione depletion in hippocampus. Further, Withanolide A increases glutathione biosynthesis in neuronal cells by upregulating GCLC level through Nrf2 pathway in a corticosterone dependenet manner.'], 'Withanolide A prevents neurodegeneration by modulating hippocampal glutathione biosynthesis during hypoxia.')   \n",

To provide evidence for the effectiveness of DBS as a treatment for dementia, we performed DBS in a rat model of dementia with intracerebroventricular administration of 192\\u2009IgG-saporins. We utilized four groups of rats, group 1, unlesioned control; group 2, cholinergic lesion; group 3, cholinergic lesion plus medial septum (MS) electrode implantation (sham stimulation); group 4, cholinergic lesions plus MS electrode implantation and stimulation. During the probe test in the water maze, performance of the lesion group decreased for measures of time spent and the number of swim crossings over the previous platform location. Interestingly, the stimulation group showed an equivalent performance to the normal group on all measures. And these are partially reversed by the electrode implantation. Acetylcholinesterase activity in the hippocampus was decreased in lesion and implantation groups, whereas activity in the stimulation group was not different from the normal group. Hippocampal neurogenesis was increased in the stimulation group. Our results revealed that DBS of MS restores spatial memory after damage to cholinergic neurons. This effect is associated with an increase in hippocampal cholinergic activity and neurogenesis.'], 'Improvements in memory after medial septum stimulation are associated with changes in hippocampal cholinergic activity and neurogenesis.')   \n",

Identification of splice sites is, therefore, crucial to understand the gene structure and variants of mRNA and protein isoforms produced by the primary RNA transcripts. Although many computational methods have been developed to detect the splice sites in humans, this is still substantially a challenging problem and further improvement of the computational model is still foreseeable. Accordingly, we developed DeepDSSR (deep donor splice site recognizer), a novel deep learning based architecture, for predicting human donor splice sites. The proposed method, built upon publicly available and highly imbalanced benchmark dataset, is comparable with the leading deep learning based methods for detecting human donor splice sites. Performance evaluation metrics show that DeepDSSR outperformed the existing deep learning based methods. Future work will improve the predictive capabilities of our model, and we will build a model for the prediction of acceptor splice sites.'], 'DeepDSSR: Deep Learning Structure for Human Donor Splice Sites Recognition.')</td>\n",

Synonymous and intronic mutations with predicted splice-altering consequence validate at a high rate on RNA-seq and are strongly deleterious in the human population. De novo mutations with predicted splice-altering consequence are significantly enriched in patients with autism and intellectual disability compared to healthy controls and validate against RNA-seq in 21 out of 28 of these patients.

Detailed analysis of cases in which our predicted branchpoint deviates from experimental data suggests a correct branchpoint is predicted in over 90% of cases. We use our predicted branchpoints to identify a novel sequence element upstream of branchpoints consistent with extended U2 snRNA base-pairing, show an association between weak branchpoints and alternative splicing, and explore the effects of genetic variants on branchpoints.

We model an alternative splicing event as the choice of a 3' acceptor site conditional on a fixed upstream 5' donor site or the choice of a 5' donor site conditional on a fixed 3' acceptor site.

Several computational techniques have been applied to create a system to predict canonical splice sites. For classification tasks, deep neural networks (DNNs) have achieved record-breaking results and often outperformed other supervised learning techniques. In this study, a new method of splice-site prediction using DNNs was proposed. The proposed system receives an input sequence data and returns an answer as to whether it is splice site. The length of input is 140 nucleotides, with the consensus sequence (i.e., \"GT\" and \"AG\" for the donor and acceptor sites, respectively) in the middle. Each input sequence model is applied to the pretrained DNN model that determines the probability that an input is a splice site. The model consists of convolutional layers and bidirectional long short-term memory network layers. The pretraining and validation were conducted using the data set tested in previously reported methods. The performance evaluation results showed that the proposed method can outperform the previous methods. In addition, the pattern learned by the DNNs was visualized as position frequency matrices (PFMs). Some of PFMs were very similar to the consensus sequence. The trained DNN model and the brief source code for the prediction system are uploaded. Further improvement will be achieved following the further development of DNNs.'], 'Human Splice-Site Prediction with Deep Neural Networks.')</td>\n",

Attitudes are mostly easier than behaviors, in line with the theory. Sixty-eight items fit the model and have good psychometric properties. The proportion of observed variance considered true is 92% and the Scale is well-targeted against the students.

The behaviour, depth and position of S. punctata were recorded through time. The direction and speed of local currents were described using an S4 current meter and the movement of drogues. Regardless of site, fish immediately oriented toward the bottom, and into the current after release. In shallow water (1.5 m), 86% of fish swam to the bottom within 2 min of release. At one site, the net horizontal displacement of fish was largely unrelated to the speed and direction of local currents; at a second site, fish could not maintain their position against the current, and the net horizontal displacement was related to the speed and direction of currents. In the intermediate depth zone, wide variability in depths of individual fish through time led to an average depth reached by fish that was between the shallow and deep zones. Based on daily increments in the otoliths, however, this variability was not related significantly to the time since entry of fish into Port Phillip Bay. In the deepest depth zone, 81% of fish remained within 1 m of the surface and their horizontal displacement was significantly related to the direction and speed of currents. Secondary dispersal of post-larval fish in the water column may be facilitated by the behaviour and vertical movements of fish, but only if fish reach deeper water, where their displacement (direction and distance) closely resembles local hydrodynamic regimes. In shallow water, fish behaviour and vertical migration actually reduce the potential for secondary dispersal.'], 'Swimming ability and behaviour of post-larvae of a temperate marine fish re-entrained in the pelagic environment.')</td>\n",

Identification of splice sites is, therefore, crucial to understand the gene structure and variants of mRNA and protein isoforms produced by the primary RNA transcripts. Although many computational methods have been developed to detect the splice sites in humans, this is still substantially a challenging problem and further improvement of the computational model is still foreseeable. Accordingly, we developed DeepDSSR (deep donor splice site recognizer), a novel deep learning based architecture, for predicting human donor splice sites. The proposed method, built upon publicly available and highly imbalanced benchmark dataset, is comparable with the leading deep learning based methods for detecting human donor splice sites. Performance evaluation metrics show that DeepDSSR outperformed the existing deep learning based methods.

Several computational techniques have been applied to create a system to predict canonical splice sites. For classification tasks, deep neural networks (DNNs) have achieved record-breaking results and often outperformed other supervised learning techniques. In this study, a new method of splice-site prediction using DNNs was proposed. The proposed system receives an input sequence data and returns an answer as to whether it is splice site. The length of input is 140 nucleotides, with the consensus sequence (i.e., \"GT\" and \"AG\" for the donor and acceptor sites, respectively) in the middle. Each input sequence model is applied to the pretrained DNN model that determines the probability that an input is a splice site. The model consists of convolutional layers and bidirectional long short-term memory network layers. The pretraining and validation were conducted using the data set tested in previously reported methods. The performance evaluation results showed that the proposed method can outperform the previous methods. In addition, the pattern learned by the DNNs was visualized as position frequency matrices (PFMs). Some of PFMs were very similar to the consensus sequence. The trained DNN model and the brief source code for the prediction system are uploaded. Further improvement will be achieved following the further development of DNNs.'], 'Human Splice-Site Prediction with Deep Neural Networks.')   \n",

The items were conceptualized and designed from five learning orientations: a Deep Approach, a Surface Approach, a Strategic Approach, Clarity of Direction and Academic Self-Confidence, to include 40 attitude items and 40 corresponding behavior items. The study aimed to create a scale and investigate its psychometric properties using a Rasch measurement model. The convenience sample consisted of 350 students at an Australian university in 1998. The analysis supported the conceptual structure of the Scale as involving studying attitudes and behaviors towards five orientations to learning. Attitudes are mostly easier than behaviors, in line with the theory. Sixty-eight items fit the model and have good psychometric properties. The proportion of observed variance considered true is 92% and the Scale is well-targeted against the students. Some harder items are needed to improve the targeting and some further testing work needs to be done on the Surface Approach.

       "12307  (['The degree to which behaviour, vertical movement and horizontal transport, in relation to local hydrodynamics, may facilitate secondary dispersal in the water column was studied in post-larval Sillaginodes punctata in Port Phillip Bay, Australia. S. punctata were captured in shallow seagrass beds and released at the surface in three depth zones (1.5, 3 and 7 m) off-shore at each of two sites to mimic the re-entrainment of fish. The behaviour, depth and position of S. punctata were recorded through time. The direction and speed of local currents were described using an S4 current meter and the movement of drogues. Regardless of site, fish immediately oriented toward the bottom, and into the current after release. In shallow water (1.5 m), 86% of fish swam to the bottom within 2 min of release. At one site, the net horizontal displacement of fish was largely unrelated to the speed and direction of local currents; at a second site, fish could not maintain their position against the current, and the net horizontal displacement was related to the speed and direction of currents. In the intermediate depth zone, wide variability in depths of individual fish through time led to an average depth reached by fish that was between the shallow and deep zones. Based on daily increments in the otoliths, however, this variability was not related significantly to the time since entry of fish into Port Phillip Bay. In the deepest depth zone, 81% of fish remained within 1 m of the surface and their horizontal displacement was significantly related to the direction and speed of currents. Secondary dispersal of post-larval fish in the water column may be facilitated by the behaviour and vertical movements of fish, but only if fish reach deeper water, where their displacement (direction and distance) closely resembles local hydrodynamic regimes. In shallow water, fish behaviour and vertical migration actually reduce the potential for secondary dispersal.'], 'Swimming ability and behaviour of post-larvae of a temperate marine fish re-entrained in the pelagic environment.')   \n",

Deep neural networks are now the state-of-the-art machine learning models across a variety of areas, from image analysis to natural language processing, and widely deployed in academia and industry. These developments have a huge potential for medical imaging technology, medical data analysis, medical diagnostics and healthcare in general, slowly being realized. We provide a short overview of recent advances and some associated challenges in machine learning applied to medical image processing and image analysis. As this has become a very broad and fast expanding field we will not survey the entire landscape of applications, but put particular focus on deep learning in MRI. Our aim is threefold: (i) give a brief introduction to deep learning with pointers to core references; (ii) indicate how deep learning has been applied to the entire MRI processing chain, from acquisition to image retrieval, from segmentation to disease prediction; (iii) provide a starting point for people interested in experimenting and perhaps contributing to the field of deep learning for medical imaging by pointing out good educational resources, state-of-the-art open-source code, and interesting sources of data and problems related medical imaging.'], 'An overview of deep learning in medical imaging focusing on MRI.')</td>\n",

Change is likely to involve revising deep-seated beliefs and expectations regarding one's self as being unworthy and others as untrustworthy (insecure internal working models). When individuals become anxious, partners can provide immediate reassurance, but the path to long-term security may hinge on addressing the individual's insecure self-perceptions; when individuals become avoidant, partners can 'soften' interactions that involve relational give-and-take, but long-term security may hinge on instilling positive associations with interdependence and trust. As described in the Attachment Security Enhancement Model (ASEM), relationships can afford optimal interactions that involve two processes working in tandem: mitigating momentary insecurity, and fostering secure working models over the long-term.\"], 'Walking a security tightrope: relationship-induced changes in attachment security.')</td>\n",

PCR was used to screen samples for Korarchaeota 16S rRNA genes. Over 500 Korarchaeota 16S rRNA genes were screened by RFLP analysis and 90 were sequenced, resulting in identification of novel Korarchaeota phylotypes and exclusive geographical variants. Korarchaeota diversity was low, as in other terrestrial geothermal systems, suggesting a marine origin for Korarchaeota with subsequent niche-invasion into terrestrial systems. Korarchaeota endemism is consistent with endemism of other terrestrial thermophiles and supports the existence of dispersal barriers. Korarchaeota were found predominantly in &gt;55°C springs at pH 4.7-8.5 at concentrations up to 6.6×10(6) 16S rRNA gene copies g(-1) wet sediment. In Yellowstone National Park (YNP), Korarchaeota were most abundant in springs with a pH range of 5.7 to 7.0. High sulfate concentrations suggest these fluids are influenced by contributions from hydrothermal vapors that may be neutralized to some extent by mixing with water from deep geothermal sources or meteoric water. In the Great Basin (GB), Korarchaeota were most abundant at spring sources of pH&lt;7.2 with high particulate C content and high alkalinity, which are likely to be buffered by the carbonic acid system. It is therefore likely that at least two different geological mechanisms in YNP and GB springs create the neutral to mildly acidic pH that is optimal for Korarchaeota. A classification support vector machine (C-SVM) trained on single analytes, two analyte combinations, or vectors from non-metric multidimensional scaling models was able to predict springs as Korarchaeota-optimal or sub-optimal habitats with accuracies up to 95%. To our knowledge, this is the most extensive analysis of the geochemical habitat of any high-level microbial taxon and the first application of a C-SVM to microbial ecology.'], 'Korarchaeota diversity, biogeography, and abundance in Yellowstone and Great Basin hot springs and ecological niche modeling based on machine learning.')</td>\n",

PCR was used to screen samples for Korarchaeota 16S rRNA genes. Over 500 Korarchaeota 16S rRNA genes were screened by RFLP analysis and 90 were sequenced, resulting in identification of novel Korarchaeota phylotypes and exclusive geographical variants. Korarchaeota diversity was low, as in other terrestrial geothermal systems, suggesting a marine origin for Korarchaeota with subsequent niche-invasion into terrestrial systems. Korarchaeota endemism is consistent with endemism of other terrestrial thermophiles and supports the existence of dispersal barriers. Korarchaeota were found predominantly in >55°C springs at pH 4.7-8.5 at concentrations up to 6.6×10(6) 16S rRNA gene copies g(-1) wet sediment. In Yellowstone National Park (YNP), Korarchaeota were most abundant in springs with a pH range of 5.7 to 7.0. High sulfate concentrations suggest these fluids are influenced by contributions from hydrothermal vapors that may be neutralized to some extent by mixing with water from deep geothermal sources or meteoric water. In the Great Basin (GB), Korarchaeota were most abundant at spring sources of pH<7.2 with high particulate C content and high alkalinity, which are likely to be buffered by the carbonic acid system. It is therefore likely that at least two different geological mechanisms in YNP and GB springs create the neutral to mildly acidic pH that is optimal for Korarchaeota. A classification support vector machine (C-SVM) trained on single analytes, two analyte combinations, or vectors from non-metric multidimensional scaling models was able to predict springs as Korarchaeota-optimal or sub-optimal habitats with accuracies up to 95%. To our knowledge, this is the most extensive analysis of the geochemical habitat of any high-level microbial taxon and the first application of a C-SVM to microbial ecology.'], 'Korarchaeota diversity, biogeography, and abundance in Yellowstone and Great Basin hot springs and ecological niche modeling based on machine learning.')   \n",

Thus, complexity may comprise a morphological filter that restricts the range of visitors and thereby increases food intake for successful foragers. Such pollinator specialization, in turn, promotes flower constancy and reduces cross-species pollen transfer, providing fitness benefits to plants with complex flowers. Since visual signals associated with floral morphological complexity are generally honest (i.e., indicate food rewards), pollinators need to perceive and process them. Physiological studies show that bees detect distant flowers through long-wavelength sensitive photoreceptors. Bees effectively perceive complex shapes and learn the positions of contours based on their spatial frequencies. Complex flowers require long handling times by naive visitors, and become highly profitable only for experienced foragers.

When the nematic director is subject to planar degenerate boundary conditions, the bend-only director field with vector lines along the parallels of all nested torodial shells is an equilibrium solution for all values of the elastic constants. Local stability analyses have shown that an instability is expected to occur for sufficiently small values of the twist elastic constant. It is natural to wonder whether in this regime the global equilibrium would be characterized by a monotonic twist, or not. In the former case, the twist distribution over the torus' circular cross-section would be represented pictorially by a fennel-like surface emanating from the centre. We prove that instead the stable twist distribution is represented by a lily-like surface. Thus, generically the twist distribution is not monotonic and its maximum may fall well within the torus, far away from the boundary.

However, test items used in commercial testing programs or in research are still predominantly written by humans, in most cases by content experts or professional item writers. Human experts are a limited resource and testing agencies incur high costs in the process of continuous renewal of item banks to sustain testing programs. Using algorithms instead holds the promise of providing unlimited resources for this crucial part of assessment development. The approach presented here deviates in several ways from previous attempts to solve this problem. In the past, automatic item generation relied either on generating clones of narrowly defined item types such as those found in language free intelligence tests (e.g., Raven's progressive matrices) or on an extensive analysis of task components and derivation of schemata to produce items with pre-specified variability that are hoped to have predictable levels of difficulty. It is somewhat unlikely that researchers utilizing these previous approaches would look at the proposed approach with favor; however, recent applications of machine learning show success in solving tasks that seemed impossible for machines not too long ago. The proposed approach uses deep learning to implement probabilistic language models, not unlike what Google brain and Amazon Alexa use for language processing and generation.\"], 'Automated Item Generation with Recurrent Neural Networks.')</td>\n",

Only a subset of potential pollinators, mainly large bees, learn to successfully forage on such flowers. Thus, complexity may comprise a morphological filter that restricts the range of visitors and thereby increases food intake for successful foragers. Such pollinator specialization, in turn, promotes flower constancy and reduces cross-species pollen transfer, providing fitness benefits to plants with complex flowers. Since visual signals associated with floral morphological complexity are generally honest (i.e., indicate food rewards), pollinators need to perceive and process them. Physiological studies show that bees detect distant flowers through long-wavelength sensitive photoreceptors. Bees effectively perceive complex shapes and learn the positions of contours based on their spatial frequencies. Complex flowers require long handling times by naive visitors, and become highly profitable only for experienced foragers. To explore possible pathways towards the evolution of floral complexity, we discuss cognitive mechanisms that potentially allow insects to persist on complex flowers despite low initial foraging gains, suggest experiments to test these mechanisms, and speculate on their adaptive value.'], 'Morphological Complexity as a Floral Signal: From Perception by Insect Pollinators to Co-Evolutionary Implications.')   \n",

When the nematic director is subject to planar degenerate boundary conditions, the bend-only director field with vector lines along the parallels of all nested torodial shells is an equilibrium solution for all values of the elastic constants. Local stability analyses have shown that an instability is expected to occur for sufficiently small values of the twist elastic constant. It is natural to wonder whether in this regime the global equilibrium would be characterized by a monotonic twist, or not. In the former case, the twist distribution over the torus' circular cross-section would be represented pictorially by a fennel-like surface emanating from the centre. We prove that instead the stable twist distribution is represented by a lily-like surface. Thus, generically the twist distribution is not monotonic and its maximum may fall well within the torus, far away from the boundary. To cope with the peculiar complexity of the elastic free-energy functional in the fully non-linear setting, we developed an ad hoc deep-learning optimization method, which here is also further validated and documented for it promises to be applicable to other similar problems, equally intractable analytically.\"], 'Non-monotonic, lily-like twist distribution in toroidal nematics.')   \n",

However, test items used in commercial testing programs or in research are still predominantly written by humans, in most cases by content experts or professional item writers.

Using algorithms instead holds the promise of providing unlimited resources for this crucial part of assessment development. The approach presented here deviates in several ways from previous attempts to solve this problem. In the past, automatic item generation relied either on generating clones of narrowly defined item types such as those found in language free intelligence tests (e.g., Raven's progressive matrices) or on an extensive analysis of task components and derivation of schemata to produce items with pre-specified variability that are hoped to have predictable levels of difficulty. It is somewhat unlikely that researchers utilizing these previous approaches would look at the proposed approach with favor; however, recent applications of machine learning show success in solving tasks that seemed impossible for machines not too long ago.

Machine learning has witnessed a tremendous amount of attention over the last few years. The current boom started around 2009 when so-called deep artificial neural networks began outperforming other established models on a number of important benchmarks. Deep neural networks are now the state-of-the-art machine learning models across a variety of areas, from image analysis to natural language processing, and widely deployed in academia and industry. These developments have a huge potential for medical imaging technology, medical data analysis, medical diagnostics and healthcare in general, slowly being realized.

Deep learning methods produce a mapping from raw inputs to desired outputs (eg, image classes). Unlike traditional machine learning methods, which require hand-engineered feature extraction from inputs, deep learning methods learn these features directly from data. With the advent of large datasets and increased computing power, these methods can produce models with exceptional performance. These models are multilayer artificial neural networks, loosely inspired by biologic neural systems. Weighted connections between nodes (neurons) in the network are iteratively adjusted based on example pairs of inputs and target outputs by back-propagating a corrective error signal through the network. For computer vision tasks, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have proven to be effective. Recently, several clinical applications of CNNs have been proposed and studied in radiology for classification, detection, and segmentation tasks. This article reviews the key concepts of deep learning for clinical radiologists, discusses technical requirements, describes emerging applications in clinical radiology, and outlines limitations and future directions in this field.

Though the most current studies are using data based methods such as deep neural networks, these methods on machine learning need big data of labeled ground truth as well as a large amount of resources for training. On the other hand, the widely used traditional methods are based on the gradient of the grayscale or color of images with using different sorts of mathematical tools to accomplish the mission. Instead of treating the outline of an object in an image as a kind of gradient of grayscale or color, our scheme deals with the edge detection as a character of an energy diffusing in the space of media such as charge-coupled device. By using the characteristic function of diffusion, the information of the energy will be extracted. The scheme preserves the structural information of images very well. Because it comes from the inhere law of images' physical property, it has a unified mathematical framework for images' edge detection under different conditions, for example, multiscales, diferent light conditions, and so on. Moreover, it has low computational complexity.\"], 'A Novel Scheme Based on the Diffusion to Edge Detection.')</td>\n",

We trained a deep-learning-based diagnostic algorithm to select an optimal subset of antigen/peptide targets and then blindly tested our xVFA using human samples (N(+) = 42, N(-) = 54), achieving an area-under-the-curve (AUC), sensitivity, and specificity of 0.950, 90.5%, and 87.0%, respectively, outperforming previous LD POC tests.

Deep learning methods produce a mapping from raw inputs to desired outputs (eg, image classes). Unlike traditional machine learning methods, which require hand-engineered feature extraction from inputs, deep learning methods learn these features directly from data. With the advent of large datasets and increased computing power, these methods can produce models with exceptional performance. These models are multilayer artificial neural networks, loosely inspired by biologic neural systems. Weighted connections between nodes (neurons) in the network are iteratively adjusted based on example pairs of inputs and target outputs by back-propagating a corrective error signal through the network. For computer vision tasks, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have proven to be effective. Recently, several clinical applications of CNNs have been proposed and studied in radiology for classification, detection, and segmentation tasks. This article reviews the key concepts of deep learning for clinical radiologists, discusses technical requirements, describes emerging applications in clinical radiology, and outlines limitations and future directions in this field.

Though the most current studies are using data based methods such as deep neural networks, these methods on machine learning need big data of labeled ground truth as well as a large amount of resources for training. On the other hand, the widely used traditional methods are based on the gradient of the grayscale or color of images with using different sorts of mathematical tools to accomplish the mission. Instead of treating the outline of an object in an image as a kind of gradient of grayscale or color, our scheme deals with the edge detection as a character of an energy diffusing in the space of media such as charge-coupled device. By using the characteristic function of diffusion, the information of the energy will be extracted. The scheme preserves the structural information of images very well. Because it comes from the inhere law of images' physical property, it has a unified mathematical framework for images' edge detection under different conditions, for example, multiscales, diferent light conditions, and so on. Moreover, it has low computational complexity.\"], 'A Novel Scheme Based on the Diffusion to Edge Detection.')   \n",

Using deep learning methods such as convolutional neural networks (CNN), it is possible to build smarter systems to forecasting future situations as well as precisely classify large amounts of data from sensors. Multi-sensor data from atmospheric pollutants measurements that involves five criteria, with the underlying analytic model unknown, need to be categorized, so do the Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) fundus images dataset. In this work, we created automatic classifiers based on a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) with two models, a simpler feedforward model with dual modules and an Inception Resnet v2 model, and various structural tweaks for classifying the data from the two tasks. For segregating multi-sensor data, we trained a deep CNN-based classifier on an image dataset extracted from the data by a novel image generating method. We created two deepened and one reductive feedforward network for DR phase classification. The validation accuracies and visualization results show that increasing deep CNN structure depth or kernels number in convolutional layers will not indefinitely improve the classification quality and that a more sophisticated model does not necessarily achieve higher performance when training datasets are quantitatively limited, while increasing training image resolution can induce higher classification accuracies for trained CNNs.

However, in most cases, DNNs are considered as black-boxes and the interpretation of their internal working mechanism is usually challenging. Given that model trust is often built on the understanding of how a model works, the interpretation of DNNs becomes more important, especially in safety-critical applications (e.g., medical diagnosis, autonomous driving). In this paper, we propose DeepVID, a Deep learning approach to Visually Interpret and Diagnose DNN models, especially image classifiers. In detail, we train a small locally-faithful model to mimic the behavior of an original cumbersome DNN around a particular data instance of interest, and the local model is sufficiently simple such that it can be visually interpreted (e.g., a linear model). Knowledge distillation is used to transfer the knowledge from the cumbersome DNN to the small model, and a deep generative model (i.e., variational auto-encoder) is used to generate neighbors around the instance of interest. Those neighbors, which come with small feature variances and semantic meanings, can effectively probe the DNN's behaviors around the interested instance and help the small model to learn those behaviors. Through comprehensive evaluations, as well as case studies conducted together with deep learning experts, we validate the effectiveness of DeepVID.\"], 'DeepVID: Deep Visual Interpretation and Diagnosis for Image Classifiers via Knowledge Distillation.')</td>\n",

Scientists attribute the relatively small amount of damage to the fact that the quake was a deep one centered about 30 miles below the earth's surface. Experts also credit modern building codes, which require new buildings to be quake-resistant, and the retrofitting of older buildings to resist quakes for the lack of damage and casualties (less than 400 injuries).

In this approach, a signal flow network is firstly constructed to overcome the parametric coupling caused by the linearization model and to ensure the independence of the parameters. The model parameters are stored in the nodes of the network, and the intermediate variables are input into the optimization pipeline to overcome the local optimization problem. A deep learning algorithm is also used to improve the accuracy and speed of convergence to a global optimal solution. The results of simulations show that the proposed method can achieve a high identification accuracy with a relative parameter identification error less than 0.001‰.

Two questionnaires were distributed to 600 visitors and 41 museum explainers. The results demonstrated both potential similarities and differences with Western contexts.

Using deep learning methods such as convolutional neural networks (CNN), it is possible to build smarter systems to forecasting future situations as well as precisely classify large amounts of data from sensors. Multi-sensor data from atmospheric pollutants measurements that involves five criteria, with the underlying analytic model unknown, need to be categorized, so do the Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) fundus images dataset. In this work, we created automatic classifiers based on a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) with two models, a simpler feedforward model with dual modules and an Inception Resnet v2 model, and various structural tweaks for classifying the data from the two tasks. For segregating multi-sensor data, we trained a deep CNN-based classifier on an image dataset extracted from the data by a novel image generating method. We created two deepened and one reductive feedforward network for DR phase classification. The validation accuracies and visualization results show that increasing deep CNN structure depth or kernels number in convolutional layers will not indefinitely improve the classification quality and that a more sophisticated model does not necessarily achieve higher performance when training datasets are quantitatively limited, while increasing training image resolution can induce higher classification accuracies for trained CNNs.

Given that model trust is often built on the understanding of how a model works, the interpretation of DNNs becomes more important, especially in safety-critical applications (e.g., medical diagnosis, autonomous driving).

In detail, we train a small locally-faithful model to mimic the behavior of an original cumbersome DNN around a particular data instance of interest, and the local model is sufficiently simple such that it can be visually interpreted (e.g., a linear model). Knowledge distillation is used to transfer the knowledge from the cumbersome DNN to the small model, and a deep generative model (i.e., variational auto-encoder) is used to generate neighbors around the instance of interest. Those neighbors, which come with small feature variances and semantic meanings, can effectively probe the DNN's behaviors around the interested instance and help the small model to learn those behaviors. Through comprehensive evaluations, as well as case studies conducted together with deep learning experts, we validate the effectiveness of DeepVID.\"], 'DeepVID: Deep Visual Interpretation and Diagnosis for Image Classifiers via Knowledge Distillation.')   \n",

Popular network architectures often add additional operations and connections to the standard architecture to enable training deeper networks. To achieve accurate results in practice, a large number of trainable parameters are often required. Here, we introduce a network architecture based on using dilated convolutions to capture features at different image scales and densely connecting all feature maps with each other. The resulting architecture is able to achieve accurate results with relatively few parameters and consists of a single set of operations, making it easier to implement, train, and apply in practice, and automatically adapts to different problems. We compare results of the proposed network architecture with popular existing architectures for several segmentation problems, showing that the proposed architecture is able to achieve accurate results with fewer parameters, with a reduced risk of overfitting the training data.'], 'A mixed-scale dense convolutional neural network for image analysis.')   \n",

Scientists attribute the relatively small amount of damage to the fact that the quake was a deep one centered about 30 miles below the earth's surface. Experts also credit modern building codes, which require new buildings to be quake-resistant, and the retrofitting of older buildings to resist quakes for the lack of damage and casualties (less than 400 injuries).

Este deseo se ve afectado por una variedad de factores, como el nivel de ingreso, las necesidades familiares y la sensación de satisfacción laboral, que están interrelacionados de maneras complejas. En los hogares agricultores, los cambios en el medio de vida ocurren con frecuencia para diversificar los recursos, aumentar el ingreso y disminuir el riesgo económico. Las RCP, dada la estructura multicapa de su perceptrón, tiene una capacidad para modelar las relaciones no lineales entre los factores mientras proporciona un grado aceptable de precisión. En relación con un conjunto de 34 caracteres (p. Ej.: educación, propiedad de navíos, satisfacción laboral), examinamos las variables de respuesta binaria deseo cambiar de trabajo y no deseo cambiar de trabajo. La mejor red tuvo una precisión de conjunto de pruebas del 97.5%. Entre los caracteres, siete afectaron significativamente el deseo por cambiar de trabajo: la etnicidad, la satisfacción laboral, el número de personas con mala salud en un mismo hogar, el número de gallos de pelea en su propiedad, la participación dentro de la pesca, los ingresos por compra y venta, y el nivel educativo.

This article introduces a novel offline self-calibration scheme in which a signal flow network is employed to reduce the amplitude errors, direct-current (DC) offsets, and phase shift without requiring extra calibration instruments. In this approach, a signal flow network is firstly constructed to overcome the parametric coupling caused by the linearization model and to ensure the independence of the parameters. The model parameters are stored in the nodes of the network, and the intermediate variables are input into the optimization pipeline to overcome the local optimization problem. A deep learning algorithm is also used to improve the accuracy and speed of convergence to a global optimal solution. The results of simulations show that the proposed method can achieve a high identification accuracy with a relative parameter identification error less than 0.001‰. The practical effects were also verified by implementing the developed technique in a capacitive APS, and the experimental results demonstrate that the sensor error after signal calibration could be reduced to only 6.98%.'], 'Self-Calibration of Angular Position Sensors by Signal Flow Networks.')   \n",

Two questionnaires were distributed to 600 visitors and 41 museum explainers. The results demonstrated both potential similarities and differences with Western contexts. Explainers appeared to prefer didactic approaches, focussing on factual knowledge rather than encouraging deep learning. Two-way communication, however, appeared to be enhanced by the use of a 'pseudo-sibling relationship' by explainers. Traditional Thai social reserve was reduced through such approaches, with visitors taking on active learning roles.

Recently, we reported a brilliant 'pointillistic' iridescence in agar-grown colony biofilms of Cellulophaga lytica and some other marine Flavobacteria that exhibit gliding motility. Bacterial iridescence is created by a unique self-organization of sub-communities of cells, but the mechanisms underlying such living photonic crystals are unknown. In this study, we used Petri dish assays to screen a large panel of potential activators or inhibitors of C. lytica's iridescence. Derivatives potentially interfering with quorum-sensing and other communication or biofilm formation processes were tested, as well as metabolic poisons or algal exoproducts. We identified an indole derivative, 5-hydroxyindole (5HI, 250\\u2009µM) which inhibited both gliding and iridescence at the colonial level. 5HI did not affect growth or cell respiration. At the microscopic level, phase-contrast imaging confirmed that 5HI inhibits the gliding motility of cells. Moreover, the lack of iridescence correlated with a perturbation of self-organization of the cell sub-communities in both the WT and a gliding-negative mutant. This effect was proved using recent advances in machine learning (deep neuronal networks). In addition to its effect on colony biofilms, 5HI was found to stimulate biofilm formation in microplates. Our data are compatible with possible roles of 5HI or marine analogues in the eco-biology of iridescent bacteria.\"], 'Colony analysis and deep learning uncover 5-hydroxyindole as an inhibitor of gliding motility and iridescence in Cellulophaga lytica.')</td>\n",

However, the systems for studying the temperature dependence of oocyte membrane permeability are either too complicated or unable to achieve wide-range precise temperature control. In addition, these systems cannot achieve the simultaneous observation of multiple oocytes. Here, we report a novel microfluidic platform that combines a precise local temperature heater/detector and a simple global water bath to achieve wide-range accurate temperature control without increasing the difficulty of fabrication, and it also realizes non-interfering, position-controllable and non-missing capture of multiple oocytes for parallel experiments to increase throughput. The permeability coefficients (Lp, Ps) of the mouse oocyte membrane exposed to cryoprotective agents (1.5 M EG and 1.5 M PG) at four temperatures (4, 15, 25 and 37 °C) are consistent with those reported in previous works, which proves the feasibility and practicality of the microfluidic platform in this study.'], 'A microfluidic platform with cell-scale precise temperature control for simultaneous investigation of the osmotic responses of multiple oocytes.')</td>\n",

Such patients develop numerous peripheral nerve sheath tumors; fortunately, only a few of these tumors are symptomatic or malignant. The tumor burden in individual patients can be remarkable, however, producing significant morbidity and requiring extensive or repeated care by a skilled neurosurgeon. Because it is impossible to predict which of the deep neurofibromas will undergo malignant transformation, it behooves clinicians and patients to be aware of any change in symptoms or growth of tumors, because early resection of MPNST offers the only chance for cure. Neurosurgical professionals should be familiar with the diagnostic criteria of the neurofibromatoses, because the patient who presents with an initial neurofibroma or schwannoma immediately falls into a category in which those disorders must be ruled out. In this regard, a family history of nerve sheath tumors is revealing and should prompt referral for a clinical genetics evaluation. Cutaneous manifestations of NFI can confirm the diagnosis at initial presentation. Missing the initial presentation of a patient with NF2 can lead to marked morbidity, such as deafness,because surveillance for subsequent tumors was inadequate. Tumorigenesis in all neurofibromatoses involves loss of tumor suppressor genes. These disorders illustrate that the two-hit loss of tumor suppressor gene model, which applies best for NF2, is oversimplified. As with most cancers,a theory of multistep progressive acquisition of genetic changes that promote unregulated grow this emerging in schwannomatosis. In addition, the hyperpigmentation and learning disability of NF 1 highlight that loss of one copy of the gene is sufficient to cause nontumoral manifestations of the disorder. Genetic counseling and testing have an important role in the diagnosis of NFI and NF2 as well as in the management of all the neurofibromatoses.'], 'The neurofibromatoses: hereditary predisposition to multiple peripheral nerve tumors.')</td>\n",

The classification is done by merging the results of detailed Monte Carlo (MC) simulations, which reproduce very well the characteristics of the white dwarf populations in the solar neighborhood, with a catalogue of real stars. The resulting composite catalogue is analyzed using a competitive learning algorithm. In particular we have used the so-called self-organized map. The MC simulated stars are used as tracers and help in identifying the resulting clusters. The results of such an strategy turn out to be quite satisfactory, suggesting that this approach can provide an useful framework for analyzing large databases of white dwarfs with well determined kinematical, spatial and photometric properties once they become available in the next decade. Moreover, the results are of astrophysical interest as well, since a straightforward interpretation of several recent astronomical observations, like the detected microlensing events in the direction of the Magellanic Clouds, the possible detection of high proper motion white dwarfs in the Hubble Deep Field and the discovery of high velocity white dwarfs in the solar neighborhood, suggests that a fraction of the baryonic dark matter component of our galaxy could be in the form of old and dim halo white dwarfs.'], 'Using self-organizing maps to identify potential halo white dwarfs.')</td>\n",

Recently, we reported a brilliant 'pointillistic' iridescence in agar-grown colony biofilms of Cellulophaga lytica and some other marine Flavobacteria that exhibit gliding motility. Bacterial iridescence is created by a unique self-organization of sub-communities of cells, but the mechanisms underlying such living photonic crystals are unknown. In this study, we used Petri dish assays to screen a large panel of potential activators or inhibitors of C. lytica's iridescence. Derivatives potentially interfering with quorum-sensing and other communication or biofilm formation processes were tested, as well as metabolic poisons or algal exoproducts. We identified an indole derivative, 5-hydroxyindole (5HI, 250\\u2009µM) which inhibited both gliding and iridescence at the colonial level. 5HI did not affect growth or cell respiration. At the microscopic level, phase-contrast imaging confirmed that 5HI inhibits the gliding motility of cells. Moreover, the lack of iridescence correlated with a perturbation of self-organization of the cell sub-communities in both the WT and a gliding-negative mutant. This effect was proved using recent advances in machine learning (deep neuronal networks). In addition to its effect on colony biofilms, 5HI was found to stimulate biofilm formation in microplates. Our data are compatible with possible roles of 5HI or marine analogues in the eco-biology of iridescent bacteria.\"], 'Colony analysis and deep learning uncover 5-hydroxyindole as an inhibitor of gliding motility and iridescence in Cellulophaga lytica.')   \n",

Such patients develop numerous peripheral nerve sheath tumors; fortunately, only a few of these tumors are symptomatic or malignant. The tumor burden in individual patients can be remarkable, however, producing significant morbidity and requiring extensive or repeated care by a skilled neurosurgeon. Because it is impossible to predict which of the deep neurofibromas will undergo malignant transformation, it behooves clinicians and patients to be aware of any change in symptoms or growth of tumors, because early resection of MPNST offers the only chance for cure. Neurosurgical professionals should be familiar with the diagnostic criteria of the neurofibromatoses, because the patient who presents with an initial neurofibroma or schwannoma immediately falls into a category in which those disorders must be ruled out. In this regard, a family history of nerve sheath tumors is revealing and should prompt referral for a clinical genetics evaluation. Cutaneous manifestations of NFI can confirm the diagnosis at initial presentation. Missing the initial presentation of a patient with NF2 can lead to marked morbidity, such as deafness,because surveillance for subsequent tumors was inadequate. Tumorigenesis in all neurofibromatoses involves loss of tumor suppressor genes. These disorders illustrate that the two-hit loss of tumor suppressor gene model, which applies best for NF2, is oversimplified. As with most cancers,a theory of multistep progressive acquisition of genetic changes that promote unregulated grow this emerging in schwannomatosis. In addition, the hyperpigmentation and learning disability of NF 1 highlight that loss of one copy of the gene is sufficient to cause nontumoral manifestations of the disorder.

The resulting composite catalogue is analyzed using a competitive learning algorithm. In particular we have used the so-called self-organized map. The MC simulated stars are used as tracers and help in identifying the resulting clusters. The results of such an strategy turn out to be quite satisfactory, suggesting that this approach can provide an useful framework for analyzing large databases of white dwarfs with well determined kinematical, spatial and photometric properties once they become available in the next decade.

The potential of applying deep-learning-based medical image analysis to computer-aided diagnosis (CAD), thus providing decision support to clinicians and improving the accuracy and efficiency of various diagnostic and treatment processes, has spurred new research and development efforts in CAD. Despite the optimism in this new era of machine learning, the development and implementation of CAD or AI tools in clinical practice face many challenges.

These algorithms have recently shown impressive results across a variety of domains. Biology and medicine are data-rich disciplines, but the data are complex and often ill-understood. Hence, deep learning techniques may be particularly well suited to solve problems of these fields. We examine applications of deep learning to a variety of biomedical problems-patient classification, fundamental biological processes and treatment of patients-and discuss whether deep learning will be able to transform these tasks or if the biomedical sphere poses unique challenges. Following from an extensive literature review, we find that deep learning has yet to revolutionize biomedicine or definitively resolve any of the most pressing challenges in the field, but promising advances have been made on the prior state of the art. Even though improvements over previous baselines have been modest in general, the recent progress indicates that deep learning methods will provide valuable means for speeding up or aiding human investigation. Though progress has been made linking a specific neural network's prediction to input features, understanding how users should interpret these models to make testable hypotheses about the system under study remains an open challenge. Furthermore, the limited amount of labelled data for training presents problems in some domains, as do legal and privacy constraints on work with sensitive health records. Nonetheless, we foresee deep learning enabling changes at both bench and bedside with the potential to transform several areas of biology and medicine.\"], 'Opportunities and obstacles for deep learning in biology and medicine.')</td>\n",

However, test items used in commercial testing programs or in research are still predominantly written by humans, in most cases by content experts or professional item writers. Human experts are a limited resource and testing agencies incur high costs in the process of continuous renewal of item banks to sustain testing programs. Using algorithms instead holds the promise of providing unlimited resources for this crucial part of assessment development. The approach presented here deviates in several ways from previous attempts to solve this problem. In the past, automatic item generation relied either on generating clones of narrowly defined item types such as those found in language free intelligence tests (e.g., Raven's progressive matrices) or on an extensive analysis of task components and derivation of schemata to produce items with pre-specified variability that are hoped to have predictable levels of difficulty. It is somewhat unlikely that researchers utilizing these previous approaches would look at the proposed approach with favor; however, recent applications of machine learning show success in solving tasks that seemed impossible for machines not too long ago.

Early studies of deep learning applied to lesion detection or classification have reported superior performance compared to those by conventional techniques or even better than radiologists in some tasks. The potential of applying deep-learning-based medical image analysis to computer-aided diagnosis (CAD), thus providing decision support to clinicians and improving the accuracy and efficiency of various diagnostic and treatment processes, has spurred new research and development efforts in CAD. Despite the optimism in this new era of machine learning, the development and implementation of CAD or AI tools in clinical practice face many challenges.

       "10599  ([\"Deep learning describes a class of machine learning algorithms that are capable of combining raw inputs into layers of intermediate features. These algorithms have recently shown impressive results across a variety of domains. Biology and medicine are data-rich disciplines, but the data are complex and often ill-understood. Hence, deep learning techniques may be particularly well suited to solve problems of these fields. We examine applications of deep learning to a variety of biomedical problems-patient classification, fundamental biological processes and treatment of patients-and discuss whether deep learning will be able to transform these tasks or if the biomedical sphere poses unique challenges. Following from an extensive literature review, we find that deep learning has yet to revolutionize biomedicine or definitively resolve any of the most pressing challenges in the field, but promising advances have been made on the prior state of the art. Even though improvements over previous baselines have been modest in general, the recent progress indicates that deep learning methods will provide valuable means for speeding up or aiding human investigation. Though progress has been made linking a specific neural network's prediction to input features, understanding how users should interpret these models to make testable hypotheses about the system under study remains an open challenge. Furthermore, the limited amount of labelled data for training presents problems in some domains, as do legal and privacy constraints on work with sensitive health records. Nonetheless, we foresee deep learning enabling changes at both bench and bedside with the potential to transform several areas of biology and medicine.\"], 'Opportunities and obstacles for deep learning in biology and medicine.')   \n",

In the past, automatic item generation relied either on generating clones of narrowly defined item types such as those found in language free intelligence tests (e.g., Raven's progressive matrices) or on an extensive analysis of task components and derivation of schemata to produce items with pre-specified variability that are hoped to have predictable levels of difficulty. It is somewhat unlikely that researchers utilizing these previous approaches would look at the proposed approach with favor; however, recent applications of machine learning show success in solving tasks that seemed impossible for machines not too long ago. The proposed approach uses deep learning to implement probabilistic language models, not unlike what Google brain and Amazon Alexa use for language processing and generation.\"], 'Automated Item Generation with Recurrent Neural Networks.')   \n",

Grades adjudicated by a panel of international retinal specialists served as the reference standard. Relative to human graders, for detecting referable DR (moderate NPDR or worse), the deep learning algorithm had significantly higher sensitivity (0.97 vs. 0.74, p\\u2009&lt;\\u20090.001), and a slightly lower specificity (0.96 vs. 0.98, p\\u2009&lt;\\u20090.001).

It aims to control wound bioburden and allows early wound closure by conservative treatment or skin grafting. Preservation of viable dermis accompanied by early wound closure, is regarded as a necessary step to reduce scar related complication, e.g. functional limitations and/or unaesthetic scar formation. Aside from the classical techniques of surgical excision as tangential excision for eschar removal, hydro-surgery, maggot therapy, laser, enzymatic debridement have been described as additional techniques in the burn surgeon's armamentarium. It is widely accepted that early eschar removal within 72h improves the outcome of burn wound treatment by reducing bacterial wound colonization, infection and length of hospital stay. In contrast, the right technique for eschar removal is still a matter of debate. There is increasing evidence that enzymatic debridement is a powerful tool to remove eschar in burn wounds, reducing blood loss, the need for autologous skin grafting and the number of wounds requiring surgical excision. In order to assess the role and clinical advantages of enzymatic debridement by a mixture of proteolytic enzymes enriched in Bromelain (Nexobrid®) beyond the scope of the literature and in view of users' experience, a European Consensus Meeting was scheduled. The aim was to provide statements for application, based on the mutual experience of applying enzymatic debridement in more than 500 adult and pediatric patients by the consensus panelists. Issues to be addressed were: indications, pain management and anesthesia, timing of application, technique of application, after-intervention care, skin grafting after enzymatic debridement, blood loss, training strategies and learning curve and areas of future research needs. Sixty-eight (68) consensus statements were provided for the use of enzymatic debridement. The degree of consensus was remarkably high, with a unanimous consensus in 88.2% of statements, and lowest degree of consensus of 70% in only 3 statements.

It is one of the most common inner ear abnormalities that cause hearing loss in children.The main performance is gradual or fluctuant hearing loss, from basic normal to extremely severe. Frequently seen in high frequencies hearing loss. The air-bone conduction gaps present in pure tone audiometry test with low frequencies. There were some inducements of intracranial pressure increases before premorbid. Some patients could be accompanied by vertigo or instability. So far, there was still no effective way to terminate the patient deafness progress.If there was no effective intervention,the speech developmental delay of children were an inevitable trend,greatly affect their normal social communication learning ability. So, early diagnosis was critical. Imaging examination was the golden criterion for the diagnosis of LAVS.Characteristic audiological performance and gene diagnosis can be the basis of the further diagnosed. Because the structure and anatomical location of vestibular aqueduct is small and deep, normal imaging examination is difficult to display its morphology and structure,so,for a long time, it did not work very well. Until the advent of High-resolution computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging, there was a breakthrough and a deeper understanding of the fine structure with inner ear.

However, with medical images, observing and quantifying associations can often be difficult because of the wide variety of features, patterns, colours, values and shapes that are present in real data. Here, we show that deep learning can extract new knowledge from retinal fundus images. Using deep-learning models trained on data from 284,335 patients and validated on two independent datasets of 12,026 and 999 patients, we predicted cardiovascular risk factors not previously thought to be present or quantifiable in retinal images, such as age (mean absolute error within 3.26 years), gender (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC)\\u2009=\\u20090.97), smoking status (AUC\\u2009=\\u20090.71), systolic blood pressure (mean absolute error within 11.23\\u2009mmHg) and major adverse cardiac events (AUC\\u2009=\\u20090.70).

This study aims to validate one such algorithm on a large-scale clinical population, and compare the algorithm performance with that of human graders. A total of 25,326 gradable retinal images of patients with diabetes from the community-based, nationwide screening program of DR in Thailand were analyzed for DR severity and referable diabetic macular edema (DME). Grades adjudicated by a panel of international retinal specialists served as the reference standard. Relative to human graders, for detecting referable DR (moderate NPDR or worse), the deep learning algorithm had significantly higher sensitivity (0.97 vs. 0.74, p\\u2009<\\u20090.001), and a slightly lower specificity (0.96 vs. 0.98, p\\u2009<\\u20090.001). Higher sensitivity of the algorithm was also observed for each of the categories of severe or worse NPDR, PDR, and DME (p\\u2009<\\u20090.001 for all comparisons). The quadratic-weighted kappa for determination of DR severity levels by the algorithm and human graders was 0.85 and 0.78 respectively (p\\u2009<\\u20090.001 for the difference). Across different severity levels of DR for determining referable disease, deep learning significantly reduced the false negative rate (by 23%) at the cost of slightly higher false positive rates (2%).

       "895    ([\"Early debridement and/or eschar removal is regarded as a significant step in the treatment of deep partial and full thickness burns. It aims to control wound bioburden and allows early wound closure by conservative treatment or skin grafting. Preservation of viable dermis accompanied by early wound closure, is regarded as a necessary step to reduce scar related complication, e.g. functional limitations and/or unaesthetic scar formation. Aside from the classical techniques of surgical excision as tangential excision for eschar removal, hydro-surgery, maggot therapy, laser, enzymatic debridement have been described as additional techniques in the burn surgeon's armamentarium. It is widely accepted that early eschar removal within 72h improves the outcome of burn wound treatment by reducing bacterial wound colonization, infection and length of hospital stay. In contrast, the right technique for eschar removal is still a matter of debate. There is increasing evidence that enzymatic debridement is a powerful tool to remove eschar in burn wounds, reducing blood loss, the need for autologous skin grafting and the number of wounds requiring surgical excision. In order to assess the role and clinical advantages of enzymatic debridement by a mixture of proteolytic enzymes enriched in Bromelain (Nexobrid®) beyond the scope of the literature and in view of users' experience, a European Consensus Meeting was scheduled. The aim was to provide statements for application, based on the mutual experience of applying enzymatic debridement in more than 500 adult and pediatric patients by the consensus panelists. Issues to be addressed were: indications, pain management and anesthesia, timing of application, technique of application, after-intervention care, skin grafting after enzymatic debridement, blood loss, training strategies and learning curve and areas of future research needs. Sixty-eight (68) consensus statements were provided for the use of enzymatic debridement.

It is one of the most common inner ear abnormalities that cause hearing loss in children.The main performance is gradual or fluctuant hearing loss, from basic normal to extremely severe. Frequently seen in high frequencies hearing loss. The air-bone conduction gaps present in pure tone audiometry test with low frequencies. There were some inducements of intracranial pressure increases before premorbid. Some patients could be accompanied by vertigo or instability. So far, there was still no effective way to terminate the patient deafness progress.If there was no effective intervention,the speech developmental delay of children were an inevitable trend,greatly affect their normal social communication learning ability. So, early diagnosis was critical. Imaging examination was the golden criterion for the diagnosis of LAVS.Characteristic audiological performance and gene diagnosis can be the basis of the further diagnosed. Because the structure and anatomical location of vestibular aqueduct is small and deep, normal imaging examination is difficult to display its morphology and structure,so,for a long time, it did not work very well. Until the advent of High-resolution computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging, there was a breakthrough and a deeper understanding of the fine structure with inner ear.

Given a standard clinical MRI, our method automatically computes the predictors and uses the learned information to predict the patient-specific STN. We validate our proposed method on clinical T2 W MRI of 80 subjects, comparing with experts-segmented STNs from the corresponding 7 T MRI pairs. The experimental results show that our framework provides more accurate and robust patient-specific STN localization than using state-of-the-art atlases.

However, the neural mechanisms through which DBS produces therapeutic benefits, and in some cases unwanted side effects, in these disorders are only partially understood. Non-invasive neuroimaging techniques that can assess the neural effects of active stimulation are important for advancing our understanding of the neural basis of DBS therapy. Magnetoencephalography (MEG) is a safe, passive imaging modality with relatively high spatiotemporal resolution, which makes it a potentially powerful method for examining the cortical network effects of DBS. However, the degree to which magnetic artifacts produced by stimulation and the associated hardware can be suppressed from MEG data, and the comparability between signals measured during DBS-on and DBS-off conditions, have not been fully quantified. The present study used machine learning methods in conjunction with a visual perception task, which should be relatively unaffected by DBS, to quantify how well neural data can be salvaged from artifact contamination introduced by DBS and how comparable DBS-on and DBS-off data are after artifact removal. Machine learning also allowed us to determine whether the spatiotemporal pattern of neural activity recorded during stimulation are comparable to those recorded when stimulation is off. The spatiotemporal patterns of visually evoked neural fields could be accurately classified in all 8 patients with DBS implants during both DBS-on and DBS-off conditions and performed comparably across those two conditions. Further, the classification accuracy for classifiers trained on the spatiotemporal patterns evoked during DBS-on trials and applied to DBS-off trials, and vice versa, were similar to that of the classifiers trained and tested on either trial type, demonstrating the comparability of these patterns across conditions. Together, these results demonstrate the ability of MEG preprocessing techniques, like temporal signal space separation, to salvage neural data from recordings contaminated with DBS artifacts and validate MEG as a powerful tool to study the cortical consequences of DBS.'], 'Quantitatively validating the efficacy of artifact suppression techniques to study the cortical consequences of deep brain stimulation with magnetoencephalography.')</td>\n",

Both caudate and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex demonstrated a beta power increase during the feedback period of the learning task that was greater following correct than incorrect trials. In dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, this difference increased with learning and persisted beyond the end of the feedback period.

We investigated local field potentials (LFPs) induced by CT-DBS from the thalamic central lateral nuclei (CL) and the striatum as potential biomarkers for the enhancement of lever-pressing skill learning. LFPs were simultaneously recorded from multiple sites in the CL, ventral striatum (Vstr), and dorsal striatum (Dstr). LFP oscillation power and functional connectivity were assessed and compared between the CT-DBS and sham control groups. The theta and alpha LFP oscillations were significantly increased in the CL and striatum in the CT-DBS group. Furthermore, interhemispheric coherences between bilateral CL and striatum were increased in the theta band. Additionally, enhancement of c-Fos activity, dopamine D2 receptor (Drd2), and α4-nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (α4-nAChR) occurred after CT-DBS treatment in the striatum and hippocampus. CT-DBS strengthened thalamic-striatal functional connectivity, which demonstrates that the inter-regional connectivity enhancement might contribute to synaptic plasticity in the striatum. Altered dopaminergic and cholinergic receptors resulted in modulation of striatal synaptic plasticity's ability to regulate downstream signaling cascades for higher brain functions of lever-pressing skill learning.\"], 'Central Thalamic Deep-Brain Stimulation Alters Striatal-Thalamic Connectivity in Cognitive Neural Behavior.')</td>\n",

Models of reinforcement learning suggest that the striatum, a basal ganglia input nucleus, vitally contributes to these learning processes. Our recently presented computational model predicts, first, that not only the striatum, but also the globus pallidus contributes to the learning (i.e., exploration) of stimulus-response associations based on rewards. Secondly, it predicts that the stable execution (i.e., exploitation) of well-learned associations involves further learning in the thalamus. To test these predictions, we postoperatively recorded local field potentials (LFPs) from patients that had undergone surgery for deep brain stimulation to treat severe movement disorders. Macroelectrodes were placed either in the globus pallidus or in the ventral thalamus. During recordings, patients performed a reward-based stimulus-response learning task that comprised periods of exploration and exploitation. We analyzed correlations between patients' LFP amplitudes and model-based estimates of their reward expectations and reward prediction errors. In line with our first prediction, pallidal LFP amplitudes during the presentation of rewards and reward omissions correlated with patients' reward prediction errors, suggesting pallidal access to reward-based teaching signals. Unexpectedly, the same was true for the thalamus. In further support of this prediction, pallidal LFP amplitudes during stimulus presentation correlated with patients' reward expectations during phases of low reward certainty - suggesting pallidal participation in the learning of stimulus-response associations. In line with our second prediction, correlations between thalamic stimulus-related LFP amplitudes and patients' reward expectations were significant within phases of already high reward certainty, suggesting thalamic participation in exploitation.\"], 'Differential contributions of the globus pallidus and ventral thalamus to stimulus-response learning in humans.')</td>\n",

       "290    (['Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is an established and effective treatment for several movement disorders and is being developed to treat a host of neuropsychiatric disorders including epilepsy, chronic pain, obsessive compulsive disorder, and depression. However, the neural mechanisms through which DBS produces therapeutic benefits, and in some cases unwanted side effects, in these disorders are only partially understood. Non-invasive neuroimaging techniques that can assess the neural effects of active stimulation are important for advancing our understanding of the neural basis of DBS therapy. Magnetoencephalography (MEG) is a safe, passive imaging modality with relatively high spatiotemporal resolution, which makes it a potentially powerful method for examining the cortical network effects of DBS. However, the degree to which magnetic artifacts produced by stimulation and the associated hardware can be suppressed from MEG data, and the comparability between signals measured during DBS-on and DBS-off conditions, have not been fully quantified. The present study used machine learning methods in conjunction with a visual perception task, which should be relatively unaffected by DBS, to quantify how well neural data can be salvaged from artifact contamination introduced by DBS and how comparable DBS-on and DBS-off data are after artifact removal. Machine learning also allowed us to determine whether the spatiotemporal pattern of neural activity recorded during stimulation are comparable to those recorded when stimulation is off. The spatiotemporal patterns of visually evoked neural fields could be accurately classified in all 8 patients with DBS implants during both DBS-on and DBS-off conditions and performed comparably across those two conditions. Further, the classification accuracy for classifiers trained on the spatiotemporal patterns evoked during DBS-on trials and applied to DBS-off trials, and vice versa, were similar to that of the classifiers trained and tested on either trial type, demonstrating the comparability of these patterns across conditions. Together, these results demonstrate the ability of MEG preprocessing techniques, like temporal signal space separation, to salvage neural data from recordings contaminated with DBS artifacts and validate MEG as a powerful tool to study the cortical consequences of DBS.'], 'Quantitatively validating the efficacy of artifact suppression techniques to study the cortical consequences of deep brain stimulation with magnetoencephalography.')   \n",

Three subjects participated in stimulation sessions during which caudate or putamen stimulation was delivered for some images during feedback after correct responses. Caudate stimulation enhanced learning. Both caudate and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex demonstrated a beta power increase during the feedback period of the learning task that was greater following correct than incorrect trials. In dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, this difference increased with learning and persisted beyond the end of the feedback period.

We investigated local field potentials (LFPs) induced by CT-DBS from the thalamic central lateral nuclei (CL) and the striatum as potential biomarkers for the enhancement of lever-pressing skill learning. LFPs were simultaneously recorded from multiple sites in the CL, ventral striatum (Vstr), and dorsal striatum (Dstr). LFP oscillation power and functional connectivity were assessed and compared between the CT-DBS and sham control groups. The theta and alpha LFP oscillations were significantly increased in the CL and striatum in the CT-DBS group. Furthermore, interhemispheric coherences between bilateral CL and striatum were increased in the theta band. Additionally, enhancement of c-Fos activity, dopamine D2 receptor (Drd2), and α4-nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (α4-nAChR) occurred after CT-DBS treatment in the striatum and hippocampus. CT-DBS strengthened thalamic-striatal functional connectivity, which demonstrates that the inter-regional connectivity enhancement might contribute to synaptic plasticity in the striatum. Altered dopaminergic and cholinergic receptors resulted in modulation of striatal synaptic plasticity's ability to regulate downstream signaling cascades for higher brain functions of lever-pressing skill learning.\"], 'Central Thalamic Deep-Brain Stimulation Alters Striatal-Thalamic Connectivity in Cognitive Neural Behavior.')   \n",

Models of reinforcement learning suggest that the striatum, a basal ganglia input nucleus, vitally contributes to these learning processes. Our recently presented computational model predicts, first, that not only the striatum, but also the globus pallidus contributes to the learning (i.e., exploration) of stimulus-response associations based on rewards. Secondly, it predicts that the stable execution (i.e., exploitation) of well-learned associations involves further learning in the thalamus. To test these predictions, we postoperatively recorded local field potentials (LFPs) from patients that had undergone surgery for deep brain stimulation to treat severe movement disorders. Macroelectrodes were placed either in the globus pallidus or in the ventral thalamus. During recordings, patients performed a reward-based stimulus-response learning task that comprised periods of exploration and exploitation. We analyzed correlations between patients' LFP amplitudes and model-based estimates of their reward expectations and reward prediction errors. In line with our first prediction, pallidal LFP amplitudes during the presentation of rewards and reward omissions correlated with patients' reward prediction errors, suggesting pallidal access to reward-based teaching signals. Unexpectedly, the same was true for the thalamus. In further support of this prediction, pallidal LFP amplitudes during stimulus presentation correlated with patients' reward expectations during phases of low reward certainty - suggesting pallidal participation in the learning of stimulus-response associations.

Educational change requires leadership, and lack of educational leadership may have impeded change in the past. In practical terms standards refer to outcomes, and thus an outcome based approach to clinical education is advocated as the one most likely to provide an appropriate framework for organisational and system change. The provision of explicit statements of learning intent, an educational process enabling acquisition and demonstration of these, and criteria for ensuring their achievement are the key features of such a framework. The derivation of an appropriate outcome set should emphasise what the learners will be able to do following the learning experience, how they will subsequently approach these tasks, and what, as a professional, they will bring to their practice. Once defined, the learning outcomes should determine, in turn, the nature of the learning experience enabling their achievement and the assessment processes to certify that they have been met. Provision of the necessary educational environment requires an understanding of the close interrelationship between learning style, learning theory, and methods whereby active and deep learning may be fostered. If desired change is to prevail, a conducive educational culture which values learning as well as evaluation, review, and enhancement must be engendered. It is the responsibility of all who teach to foster such an environment and culture, for all practitioners involved in health care have a leadership role in education.'], 'Educational outcomes and leadership to meet the needs of modern health care.')</td>\n",

Drawing from social learning theory (Bandura, 1973), we argue that supervisors' history of family aggression indirectly impacts abusive supervision via both hostile cognitions and hostile affect, with angry rumination functioning as a first-stage moderator. Using multisource data, we tested the proposed relationships in a series of 4 studies, each providing evidence of constructive replication. In Study 1, we found positive relationships between supervisors' history of family aggression, hostile affect, explicit hostile cognitions, and abusive supervision. We obtained the same pattern of results in Studies 2, 3, and 4 using an implicit measure of hostile cognitions and controlling for previously established antecedents of abusive supervision. Angry rumination moderated the indirect relationship between supervisors' history of family aggression and abusive supervision via hostile affect only.

TH is essential for human and animal development, growth, and function of multiple organs. Children with deficient TH can develop alterations in central nervous system (CNS), striated muscle, bone tissue, liver, bone marrow, and cardiorespiratory system. Among the clinical outlook are signs like breathing difficulty, cardiac insufficiency, dysphagia, and repeated bronchial aspiration, constipation, muscle weakness, cognitive alterations, cochlear dysfunction, reduced height, defects in temperature regulation, anaemia, jaundice, susceptibility to infection, and others. Experimental and clinical studies have shown that TH is very essential for normal brain development. Other research work based on mice pointed out that a reduced level of TH in pregnant mother leads to congenital hypothyroidism in animal models and it is associated with mental retardation, deep neurologic deficiency that impacts on cognitive, learning, and memory functions. The principal experimental model studies that have focused on hypothyroidism are reviewed in this study.

We then measured divine love at 900 days postoperatively. Hierarchical linear regression indicated the direct effect of positive religious coping on experiences of divine love, controlling for other key variables. Postoperatively perceived spiritual support was entered at the final step as an explanatory factor, which appeared to mediate the coping effect. None of the other faith factors predicted divine love.

Through this case, the authors draw attention to the difficulty of achieving an emergency tracheotomy in the presence of goiter and emphasize the need for integration of different modes of learning and retention of management skills of the upper airway.'], '[Difficult intubation: should follow the recommendations].')</td>\n",

       "12355  (['If professionals are to be equipped better to meet the needs of modern health care systems and the standards of practice required, significant educational change is still required. Educational change requires leadership, and lack of educational leadership may have impeded change in the past. In practical terms standards refer to outcomes, and thus an outcome based approach to clinical education is advocated as the one most likely to provide an appropriate framework for organisational and system change. The provision of explicit statements of learning intent, an educational process enabling acquisition and demonstration of these, and criteria for ensuring their achievement are the key features of such a framework. The derivation of an appropriate outcome set should emphasise what the learners will be able to do following the learning experience, how they will subsequently approach these tasks, and what, as a professional, they will bring to their practice. Once defined, the learning outcomes should determine, in turn, the nature of the learning experience enabling their achievement and the assessment processes to certify that they have been met. Provision of the necessary educational environment requires an understanding of the close interrelationship between learning style, learning theory, and methods whereby active and deep learning may be fostered. If desired change is to prevail, a conducive educational culture which values learning as well as evaluation, review, and enhancement must be engendered. It is the responsibility of all who teach to foster such an environment and culture, for all practitioners involved in health care have a leadership role in education.'], 'Educational outcomes and leadership to meet the needs of modern health care.')   \n",

Drawing from social learning theory (Bandura, 1973), we argue that supervisors' history of family aggression indirectly impacts abusive supervision via both hostile cognitions and hostile affect, with angry rumination functioning as a first-stage moderator. Using multisource data, we tested the proposed relationships in a series of 4 studies, each providing evidence of constructive replication. In Study 1, we found positive relationships between supervisors' history of family aggression, hostile affect, explicit hostile cognitions, and abusive supervision. We obtained the same pattern of results in Studies 2, 3, and 4 using an implicit measure of hostile cognitions and controlling for previously established antecedents of abusive supervision. Angry rumination moderated the indirect relationship between supervisors' history of family aggression and abusive supervision via hostile affect only. Overall, the results highlight the important role of supervisor-level factors in the abusive supervision dynamics.\"], 'Roots run deep: Investigating psychological mechanisms between history of family aggression and abusive supervision.')   \n",

TH is essential for human and animal development, growth, and function of multiple organs. Children with deficient TH can develop alterations in central nervous system (CNS), striated muscle, bone tissue, liver, bone marrow, and cardiorespiratory system. Among the clinical outlook are signs like breathing difficulty, cardiac insufficiency, dysphagia, and repeated bronchial aspiration, constipation, muscle weakness, cognitive alterations, cochlear dysfunction, reduced height, defects in temperature regulation, anaemia, jaundice, susceptibility to infection, and others. Experimental and clinical studies have shown that TH is very essential for normal brain development. Other research work based on mice pointed out that a reduced level of TH in pregnant mother leads to congenital hypothyroidism in animal models and it is associated with mental retardation, deep neurologic deficiency that impacts on cognitive, learning, and memory functions. The principal experimental model studies that have focused on hypothyroidism are reviewed in this study. This is important on considering the fact that almost all animal species require thyroid hormones for their metabolism.\"], 'Experimental models of developmental hypothyroidism.')   \n",

These patients previously completed two-wave preoperative interviews when standardized cardiac surgery data were also collected. The information included left ventricular ejection fraction, New York Heart Association Classification, baseline health (physical and mental), optimism, hope, religiousness, prayer coping, religious/spiritual coping, and demographics. We then measured divine love at 900 days postoperatively. Hierarchical linear regression indicated the direct effect of positive religious coping on experiences of divine love, controlling for other key variables. Postoperatively perceived spiritual support was entered at the final step as an explanatory factor, which appeared to mediate the coping effect. None of the other faith factors predicted divine love.

PPAs provide the basis for communicating the results of one restoration scheme to another, thereby improving future restoration designs. They also supply essential performance feedback needed for adaptive management, in which management actions are treated as experiments. PPAs allow river restoration success to be defined both in terms of the scheme attaining its performance objectives and in providing a significant learning experience. Different levels of investment in PPA, in terms of pre-project data and follow-up information, bring with them different degrees of understanding and tbus different abilities to gauge both types of success. We present four case studies to illustrate how the commitment to PPA has determined the understanding achieved in each case. In Moore's Gulch (California, USA), understanding was severely constrained by the lack of pre-project data and post-implementation monitoring. Pre-project data existed for the Kitswell Brook (Hertfordshire, UK), but the monitoring consisted only of one site visit and thus the understanding achieved is related primarily to design compliance issues. The monitoring undertaken for Deep Run (Maryland, USA) and the River Idle (Nottinghamshire, UK) enabled some understanding of the short-term performance of each scheme. The transferable understanding gained from each case study is used to develop an illustrative five-fold classification of geomorphological PPAs (full, medium-term, short-term, one-shot, and remains) according to their potential as learning experiences. The learning experience is central to adaptive management but rarely articulated in the literature. Here, we gauge the potential via superimposition onto a previous schematic representation of the adaptive management process by Haney and Power (1996). Using PPAs wisely can lead to cutting-edge, complex solutions to river restoration challenges.\"], 'Post-project appraisals in adaptive management of river channel restoration.')</td>\n",

We argue that non-stationarity poses profound challenges for existing science and that new integration of the natural sciences, engineering and social sciences is needed to address decision making under deep uncertainty. We suggest that vulnerability analysis can be combined with scenario-based modelling to address issues of water security and that knowledge translation should be coupled with place-based modelling, adaptive governance and social learning to address the complexity uncertainty and scale dynamics of contemporary water problems.'], 'Water security in the Canadian Prairies: science and management challenges.')   \n",

This practical challenge of risk management with model uncertainty arises in problems from preparing for climate change to managing emerging diseases to operating complex and hazardous facilities safely. We review constructive methods for robust and adaptive risk analysis under deep uncertainty. These methods are not yet as familiar to many risk analysts as older statistical and model-based methods, such as the paradigm of identifying a single \"best-fitting\" model and performing sensitivity analyses for its conclusions. They provide genuine breakthroughs for improving predictions and decisions when the correct model is highly uncertain.

       "12425  ([\"Post-project appraisals (PPAs) can evaluate river restoration schemes in relation to their compliance with design, their short-term performance attainment, and their longer-term geomorphological compatibility with the catchment hydrology and sediment transport processes. PPAs provide the basis for communicating the results of one restoration scheme to another, thereby improving future restoration designs. They also supply essential performance feedback needed for adaptive management, in which management actions are treated as experiments. PPAs allow river restoration success to be defined both in terms of the scheme attaining its performance objectives and in providing a significant learning experience. Different levels of investment in PPA, in terms of pre-project data and follow-up information, bring with them different degrees of understanding and tbus different abilities to gauge both types of success. We present four case studies to illustrate how the commitment to PPA has determined the understanding achieved in each case. In Moore's Gulch (California, USA), understanding was severely constrained by the lack of pre-project data and post-implementation monitoring. Pre-project data existed for the Kitswell Brook (Hertfordshire, UK), but the monitoring consisted only of one site visit and thus the understanding achieved is related primarily to design compliance issues. The monitoring undertaken for Deep Run (Maryland, USA) and the River Idle (Nottinghamshire, UK) enabled some understanding of the short-term performance of each scheme. The transferable understanding gained from each case study is used to develop an illustrative five-fold classification of geomorphological PPAs (full, medium-term, short-term, one-shot, and remains) according to their potential as learning experiences. The learning experience is central to adaptive management but rarely articulated in the literature. Here, we gauge the potential via superimposition onto a previous schematic representation of the adaptive management process by Haney and Power (1996). Using PPAs wisely can lead to cutting-edge, complex solutions to river restoration challenges.\"], 'Post-project appraisals in adaptive management of river channel restoration.')   \n",

This process is thought to proceed through two learning phases: one leading to memory acquisition; and the other leading more slowly to memory consolidation and saving. It has been proposed that fast acquisition occurs in the cerebellar cortex, while consolidation is dislocated into the deep cerebellar nuclei. However, it was not clear how these two components could be identified in eyeblink classical conditioning (EBCC) in humans, a paradigm commonly used to investigate associative learning. In 22 subjects, we show that EBCC proceeded through a fast acquisition phase, returned toward basal levels during extinction and then was consolidated, as it became evident from the saving effect observed when re-testing the subjects after 1 week of initial training. The results were fitted using a two-state multi-rate learning model extended to account for memory consolidation. Transcranial magnetic stimulation was used to apply continuous theta-burst stimulation (cTBS) to the lateral cerebellum just after the first training session. Half of the subjects received real cTBS and half sham cTBS. After cTBS, but not sham cTBS, consolidation was unaltered but the extinction process was significantly impaired. These data suggest that cTBS can dissociate EBCC extinction (related to the fast learning process) from consolidation (related to the slow learning process), probably by acting through a selective alteration of cerebellar plasticity.'], 'Cerebellar theta burst stimulation dissociates memory components in eyeblink classical conditioning.')</td>\n",

       "      <td>([\"Parkinson's disease (PD), characterized by the loss of dopaminergic nigrostriatal projections, is a debilitating neurodegenerative disease which produces bradykinesia, rigidity, tremor and postural instability. The dopamine precursor levodopa (L-Dopa) is the most effective treatment for the amelioration of PD signs and symptoms, but long-term administration can lead to disabling motor fluctuations and L-Dopa-induced dyskinesias. In animal models of PD, a form of plasticity called depotentiation, or the reversal of previous potentiation, is selectively lost after the development of dyskinetic movements following L-Dopa treatment. We investigated whether low frequency stimulation (LFS) in the globus pallidus internus (GPi) and substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNr) could induce depotentiation at synapses that had already undergone high frequency stimulation (HFS)-induced potentiation. To do so, we measured the field potentials (fEPs) evoked by stimulation from a nearby microelectrode in 28 patients undergoing implantation of deep brain stimulating (DBS) electrodes in the subthalamic nucleus (STN) or GPi. We found that GPi and SNr synapses in patients with less severe dyskinesia underwent greater depotentiation following LFS than in patients with more severe dyskinesia. This demonstration of impaired depotentiation in basal ganglia output nuclei in PD patients with dyskinesia is an important validation of animal models of levodopa-induced dyskinesia. The ability of a synapse to reverse previous potentiation may be crucial to the normal function of the BG, perhaps by preventing saturation of the storage capacity required in motor learning and optimal motor function. Loss of this ability at the output nuclei may underlie, or contribute to the cellular basis of dyskinetic movements.\"], 'Lack of depotentiation at basal ganglia output neurons in PD patients with levodopa-induced dyskinesia.')</td>\n",

During each visit, stimulation parameters are adjusted until desired therapeutic effects are achieved and adverse effects are minimized. However, the efficacy of these therapeutic parameters may decline with time due at least in part to disease progression, interactions between the host environment and the electrode, and lead migration. As such, development of closed-loop control systems that can respond to changing neurochemical environments, tailoring DBS therapy to individual patients, is paramount for improving the therapeutic efficacy of DBS. Evidence obtained using electrophysiology and imaging techniques in both animals and humans suggests that DBS works by modulating neural network activity. Recently, animal studies have shown that stimulation-evoked changes in neurotransmitter release that mirror normal physiology are associated with the therapeutic benefits of DBS. Therefore, to fully understand the neurophysiology of DBS and optimize its efficacy, it may be necessary to look beyond conventional electrophysiological analyses and characterize the neurochemical effects of therapeutic and non-therapeutic stimulation. By combining electrochemical monitoring and mathematical modeling techniques, we can potentially replace the trial-and-error process used in clinical programming with deterministic approaches that help attain optimal and stable neurochemical profiles. In this manuscript, we summarize the current understanding of electrophysiological and electrochemical processing for control of neuromodulation therapies.

This review outlines some of the recently developed AI methods aiding the drug treatment and administration process. Selection of the best drug(s) for a patient typically requires the integration of patient data, such as genetics or proteomics, with drug data, like compound chemical descriptors, to score the therapeutic efficacy of drugs. The prediction of drug interactions often relies on similarity metrics, assuming that drugs with similar structures or targets will have comparable behavior or may interfere with each other. Optimizing the dosage schedule for administration of drugs is performed using mathematical models to interpret pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic data.

Many computational methods for TFBS prediction need sufficient labeled data. However, many transcription factors (TFs) lack labeled data in cell types. We propose a novel method, referred to as DANN_TF, for TFBS prediction. DANN_TF consists of a feature extractor, a label predictor, and a domain classifier. The feature extractor and the domain classifier constitute an Adversarial Network, which ensures that learned features are common features across different cell types. DANN_TF is evaluated on five TFs in five cell types with a total of 25 cell-type TF pairs and compared to a baseline method which does not use Adversarial Network. For both data augmentation and cross-cell-type prediction, DANN_TF performs better than the baseline method on most cell-type TF pairs. DANN_TF is further evaluated by an additional 13 TFs in the five cell types with a total of 65 cell-type TF pairs. Results show that DANN_TF achieves significantly higher AUC than the baseline method on 96.9% pairs of the 65 cell-type TF pairs. This is a strong indication that DANN_TF can indeed learn common features for cross-cell-type TFBS prediction.'], 'Cross-Cell-Type Prediction of TF-Binding Site by Integrating Convolutional Neural Network and Adversarial Network.')   \n",

This process is thought to proceed through two learning phases: one leading to memory acquisition; and the other leading more slowly to memory consolidation and saving. It has been proposed that fast acquisition occurs in the cerebellar cortex, while consolidation is dislocated into the deep cerebellar nuclei. However, it was not clear how these two components could be identified in eyeblink classical conditioning (EBCC) in humans, a paradigm commonly used to investigate associative learning. In 22 subjects, we show that EBCC proceeded through a fast acquisition phase, returned toward basal levels during extinction and then was consolidated, as it became evident from the saving effect observed when re-testing the subjects after 1 week of initial training. The results were fitted using a two-state multi-rate learning model extended to account for memory consolidation. Transcranial magnetic stimulation was used to apply continuous theta-burst stimulation (cTBS) to the lateral cerebellum just after the first training session. Half of the subjects received real cTBS and half sham cTBS. After cTBS, but not sham cTBS, consolidation was unaltered but the extinction process was significantly impaired. These data suggest that cTBS can dissociate EBCC extinction (related to the fast learning process) from consolidation (related to the slow learning process), probably by acting through a selective alteration of cerebellar plasticity.'], 'Cerebellar theta burst stimulation dissociates memory components in eyeblink classical conditioning.')   \n",

The dopamine precursor levodopa (L-Dopa) is the most effective treatment for the amelioration of PD signs and symptoms, but long-term administration can lead to disabling motor fluctuations and L-Dopa-induced dyskinesias. In animal models of PD, a form of plasticity called depotentiation, or the reversal of previous potentiation, is selectively lost after the development of dyskinetic movements following L-Dopa treatment. We investigated whether low frequency stimulation (LFS) in the globus pallidus internus (GPi) and substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNr) could induce depotentiation at synapses that had already undergone high frequency stimulation (HFS)-induced potentiation. To do so, we measured the field potentials (fEPs) evoked by stimulation from a nearby microelectrode in 28 patients undergoing implantation of deep brain stimulating (DBS) electrodes in the subthalamic nucleus (STN) or GPi. We found that GPi and SNr synapses in patients with less severe dyskinesia underwent greater depotentiation following LFS than in patients with more severe dyskinesia. This demonstration of impaired depotentiation in basal ganglia output nuclei in PD patients with dyskinesia is an important validation of animal models of levodopa-induced dyskinesia. The ability of a synapse to reverse previous potentiation may be crucial to the normal function of the BG, perhaps by preventing saturation of the storage capacity required in motor learning and optimal motor function. Loss of this ability at the output nuclei may underlie, or contribute to the cellular basis of dyskinetic movements.\"], 'Lack of depotentiation at basal ganglia output neurons in PD patients with levodopa-induced dyskinesia.')   \n",
       "4538809  (['Current strategies for optimizing deep brain stimulation (DBS) therapy involve multiple postoperative visits. During each visit, stimulation parameters are adjusted until desired therapeutic effects are achieved and adverse effects are minimized. However, the efficacy of these therapeutic parameters may decline with time due at least in part to disease progression, interactions between the host environment and the electrode, and lead migration. As such, development of closed-loop control systems that can respond to changing neurochemical environments, tailoring DBS therapy to individual patients, is paramount for improving the therapeutic efficacy of DBS. Evidence obtained using electrophysiology and imaging techniques in both animals and humans suggests that DBS works by modulating neural network activity. Recently, animal studies have shown that stimulation-evoked changes in neurotransmitter release that mirror normal physiology are associated with the therapeutic benefits of DBS. Therefore, to fully understand the neurophysiology of DBS and optimize its efficacy, it may be necessary to look beyond conventional electrophysiological analyses and characterize the neurochemical effects of therapeutic and non-therapeutic stimulation. By combining electrochemical monitoring and mathematical modeling techniques, we can potentially replace the trial-and-error process used in clinical programming with deterministic approaches that help attain optimal and stable neurochemical profiles. In this manuscript, we summarize the current understanding of electrophysiological and electrochemical processing for control of neuromodulation therapies. Additionally, we describe a proof-of-principle closed-loop controller that characterizes DBS-evoked dopamine changes to adjust stimulation parameters in a rodent model of DBS.

We studied the spatial distribution of high-frequency oscillations and their relation to PD motor symptoms. We included 10 PD patients in medication OFF who underwent implantation of deep brain stimulation (DBS) electrodes. Intraoperative five-channel microelectrode recordings were performed at 9 to 10 recording sites within the subthalamic nucleus and its immediate surroundings.

Both electrodes were compared in a prospective, randomized, controlled cross-over study using 4 Hz as the conditioning LFS compared to 30 Hz (intended sham condition). Quantitative sensory testing (QST) was used to examine 13 thermal and mechanical detection and pain thresholds. Sixteen healthy volunteers (10 women, age 31.0 ± 12.7 years) were examined. Depending on the electrodes and frequencies used a divergent pattern of sensory minus signs occurred. Using LFS the concentric electrode increased thermal thresholds, while the matrix electrode rather increased mechanical including deep pain thresholds. Findings after cutaneous neuromodulation using LFS and a matrix electrode are consistent with the concept of heterosynaptic LTD in the human nociceptive system, where deep pain sensitivity was reduced after superficial stimulation of intraepidermal nerve fibres.
