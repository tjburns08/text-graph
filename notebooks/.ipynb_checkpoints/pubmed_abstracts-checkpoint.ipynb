Construction of a low-dimensional model to effectively reduce the dimensionality of the imaging problem has recently shown great promise in improving these tradeoffs. This paper presents a new approach to model and reconstruct the spectroscopic signals by learning a nonlinear low-dimensional representation of the general MR spectra. Specifically, we trained a deep neural network to capture the low-dimensional manifold, where the high-dimensional spectroscopic signals reside. A regularization formulation is proposed to effectively integrate the learned model and physics-based data acquisition model for MRSI reconstruction with the capability to incorporate additional spatiospectral constraints. An efficient numerical algorithm was developed to solve the associated optimization problem involving back-propagating the trained network. Simulation and experimental results were obtained to demonstrate the representation power of the learned model and the ability of the proposed formulation in producing SNR-enhancing reconstruction from the practical MRSI data.'], 'Constrained Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopic Imaging by Learning Nonlinear Low-Dimensional Models.')</td>\n",

This was followed by the covalent binding of GOx to graphene-functionalized GCE using 1-ethyl-3-[3-dimethylaminopropyl]carbodiimide hydrochloride (EDC) based crosslinking. Graphene provided signal enhancement by providing greater surface area for GOx binding, while APTES-functionalization led to a higher GOx immobilization density by providing free amino groups for crosslinking.

There was no interference from endogenous electroactive substances and drug metabolites. The developed biosensor was further validated for detecting blood glucose in commercial artificial blood glucose linearity standards in the range 1.4-27.9 mM.

Both caused severe pneumonia killing 774 and 858 people with 8700 cases of confirmed infection for the former, and 2494 for the latter, causing significant economic losses. 8 years later, despite the MERS outbreak remaining in certain parts of the world, at the end of 2019, a new zoonotic coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) and responsible of coronavirus Disease (COVID-19), arose from Wuhan, Hubei Province, China. It spread rapidly and to date has killed 3,242 persons with more than 81,000 cases of infection in China and causing over 126,000 global cases and 5,414 deaths in 166 other countries around the world, especially Italy. SARS-CoV-2 would seem to have come from a bat, but the intermediate reservoir continues to be unknown. Nonetheless, as for SARS-CoV and MERS CoV, the Spillover effect linked to animal-human promiscuity, human activities including deforestation, illegal bush-trafficking and bushmeat, cannot be excluded. Recently, however, evidence of inter-human only transmission of SARS-CoV-2 has been accumulated and thus, the outbreak seems to be spreading by human-to-human transmission throughout a large part of the world.

I show how PPS representation is not only multisensory, but actually multisensory-motor, as the PPS system interacts with motor areas to trigger appropriate responses. The extent of PPS is not fixed, but it is shaped by experience, as PPS may encompass farther portions of space, once the individual has interacted with them, (e.g., with tools), or it contracts, if interactions are limited because of external constraints, body, or brain injury. Interactions between the individual and the environment are not only physical but may also be \"abstract\". Recent data show that PPS adapts as a consequence of technology-mediated or social interactions. Finally, I propose that besides low-level sensory-motor representations of the space around the different parts of the body, mediating body-objects interactions, the multisensory PPS system also underlies a general representation of the self as distinct from the environment and the others.

The rat parietal cortex can be subdivided into four distinct rostral-caudal and medial-lateral regions, which includes a zone previously characterized as secondary visual cortex. At present, very little is known regarding the relative connectivity of these parietal subdivisions. Thus, we set out to map the connectivity of the entire anterior-posterior and medial-lateral span of this region. To do this we used anterograde and retrograde tracers in conjunction with open source neuronal segmentation and tracer detection tools to generate whole brain connectivity maps of parietal inputs and outputs. Our present results show that inputs to the parietal cortex varied significantly along the medial-lateral, but not the rostral-caudal axis. Specifically, retrosplenial connectivity is greater medially, but connectivity with visual cortex, though generally sparse, is more significant laterally. Finally, based on connection density, the connectivity between parietal cortex and hippocampus is indirect and likely achieved largely via dysgranular retrosplenial cortex.

Construction of a low-dimensional model to effectively reduce the dimensionality of the imaging problem has recently shown great promise in improving these tradeoffs. This paper presents a new approach to model and reconstruct the spectroscopic signals by learning a nonlinear low-dimensional representation of the general MR spectra. Specifically, we trained a deep neural network to capture the low-dimensional manifold, where the high-dimensional spectroscopic signals reside. A regularization formulation is proposed to effectively integrate the learned model and physics-based data acquisition model for MRSI reconstruction with the capability to incorporate additional spatiospectral constraints. An efficient numerical algorithm was developed to solve the associated optimization problem involving back-propagating the trained network. Simulation and experimental results were obtained to demonstrate the representation power of the learned model and the ability of the proposed formulation in producing SNR-enhancing reconstruction from the practical MRSI data.'], 'Constrained Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopic Imaging by Learning Nonlinear Low-Dimensional Models.')   \n",

This limits their potential applications, e.g., in mobile devices. In this paper, we propose a lightweight pyramid networt (LPNet) for single-image deraining. Instead of designing a complex network structure, we use domain-specific knowledge to simplify the learning process. In particular, we find that by introducing the mature Gaussian-Laplacian image pyramid decomposition technology to the neural network, the learning problem at each pyramid level is greatly simplified and can be handled by a relatively shallow network with few parameters. We adopt recursive and residual network structures to build the proposed LPNet, which has less than 8K parameters while still achieving the state-of-the-art performance on rain removal. We also discuss the potential value of LPNet for other low- and high-level vision tasks.'], 'Lightweight Pyramid Networks for Image Deraining.')   \n",

However, due to the lack of dense annotation of large-scale chest radiograph data, this computer-aided diagnosis task is intrinsically a weakly supervised learning problem and remains challenging. In this paper, we propose a novel deep convolutional neural network called Thorax-Net to diagnose 14 thorax diseases using chest radiography. Thorax-Net consists of a classification branch and an attention branch. The classification branch serves as a uniform feature extraction-classification network to free users from the troublesome hand-crafted feature extraction and classifier construction. The attention branch exploits the correlation between class labels and the locations of pathological abnormalities via analyzing the feature maps learned by the classification branch. Feeding a chest radiograph to the trained Thorax-Net, a diagnosis is obtained by averaging and binarizing the outputs of two branches. The proposed Thorax-Net model has been evaluated against three state-of-the-art deep learning models using the patientwise official split of the ChestX-ray14 dataset and against other five deep learning models using the imagewise random data split. Our results show that Thorax-Net achieves an average per-class area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.7876 and 0.896 in both experiments, respectively, which are higher than the AUC values obtained by other deep models when they were all trained with no external data.'], 'Thorax-Net: An Attention Regularized Deep Neural Network for Classification of Thoracic Diseases on Chest Radiography.')   \n",

The prediction of drug interactions often relies on similarity metrics, assuming that drugs with similar structures or targets will have comparable behavior or may interfere with each other.

This important role has recently been extended, first to other forms of vocal learning in animals and then also to other forms of motor learning. The homology in structure and in function among the FoxP gene members raises the possibility that the ancestral FoxP gene may have evolved as a crucial component of the neural circuitry mediating motor learning. Here we report that genetic manipulations of the single Drosophila orthologue, dFoxP, disrupt operant self-learning, a form of motor learning sharing several conceptually analogous features with language acquisition. Structural alterations of the dFoxP locus uncovered the role of dFoxP in operant self-learning and habit formation, as well as the dispensability of dFoxP for operant world-learning, in which no motor learning occurs. These manipulations also led to subtle alterations in the brain anatomy, including a reduced volume of the optic glomeruli. RNAi-mediated interference with dFoxP expression levels copied the behavioral phenotype of the mutant flies, even in the absence of mRNA degradation. Our results provide evidence that motor learning and language acquisition share a common ancestral trait still present in extant invertebrates, manifest in operant self-learning. This 'deep' homology probably traces back to before the split between vertebrate and invertebrate animals.\"], 'Drosophila FoxP mutants are deficient in operant self-learning.')   \n",

Eyeblink conditioning has been used for decades a model system for elucidating cerebellar learning mechanisms. The standard model of the mechanisms underlying eyeblink conditioning is that there two synaptic plasticity processes within the cerebellum that are necessary for acquisition of the conditioned response: (1) long-term depression (LTD) at parallel fiber-Purkinje cell synapses and (2) long-term potentiation (LTP) at mossy fiber-interpositus nucleus synapses. Additional Purkinje cell plasticity mechanisms may also contribute to eyeblink conditioning including LTP, excitability, and entrainment of deep nucleus activity. Recent analyses of the sensory input pathways necessary for eyeblink conditioning indicate that the cerebellum regulates its inputs to facilitate learning and maintain plasticity. Cerebellar learning during eyeblink conditioning is therefore a dynamic interactive process which maximizes responding to significant stimuli and suppresses responding to irrelevant or redundant stimuli.

Present study explores the ameliorative effect of withanolide A, a major component of withania root extract and its molecular mechanism against hypoxia induced memory impairment. Withanolide A was administered to male Sprague Dawley rats before a period of 21 days pre-exposure and during 07 days of exposure to a simulated altitude of 25,000 ft. Glutathione level and glutathione dependent free radicals scavenging enzyme system, ATP, NADPH level, γ-glutamylcysteinyl ligase (GCLC) activity and oxidative stress markers were assessed in the hippocampus. Expression of apoptotic marker caspase 3 in hippocampus was investigated by immunohistochemistry. Transcriptional alteration and expression of GCLC and Nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-related factor 2 (Nrf2) were investigated by real time PCR and immunoblotting respectively. Exposure to hypobaric hypoxia decreased reduced glutathione (GSH) level and impaired reduced gluatathione dependent free radical scavenging system in hippocampus resulting in elevated oxidative stress. Supplementation of withanolide A during hypoxic exposure increased GSH level, augmented GSH dependent free radicals scavenging system and decreased the number of caspase and hoescht positive cells in hippocampus. While withanolide A reversed hypoxia mediated neurodegeneration, administration of buthionine sulfoximine along with withanolide A blunted its neuroprotective effects. Exogenous administration of corticosterone suppressed Nrf2 and GCLC expression whereas inhibition of corticosterone synthesis upregulated Nrf2 as well as GCLC. Thus present study infers that withanolide A reduces neurodegeneration by restoring hypoxia induced glutathione depletion in hippocampus. Further, Withanolide A increases glutathione biosynthesis in neuronal cells by upregulating GCLC level through Nrf2 pathway in a corticosterone dependenet manner.'], 'Withanolide A prevents neurodegeneration by modulating hippocampal glutathione biosynthesis during hypoxia.')   \n",

To provide evidence for the effectiveness of DBS as a treatment for dementia, we performed DBS in a rat model of dementia with intracerebroventricular administration of 192\\u2009IgG-saporins. We utilized four groups of rats, group 1, unlesioned control; group 2, cholinergic lesion; group 3, cholinergic lesion plus medial septum (MS) electrode implantation (sham stimulation); group 4, cholinergic lesions plus MS electrode implantation and stimulation. During the probe test in the water maze, performance of the lesion group decreased for measures of time spent and the number of swim crossings over the previous platform location. Interestingly, the stimulation group showed an equivalent performance to the normal group on all measures. And these are partially reversed by the electrode implantation. Acetylcholinesterase activity in the hippocampus was decreased in lesion and implantation groups, whereas activity in the stimulation group was not different from the normal group. Hippocampal neurogenesis was increased in the stimulation group. Our results revealed that DBS of MS restores spatial memory after damage to cholinergic neurons.

       "3      (['18 years ago, in 2002, the world was astonished by the appearance of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), supported by a zoonotic coronavirus, called SARS-CoV, from the Guangdong Province of southern China. After about 10 years, in 2012, another similar coronavirus triggered the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV) in Saudi Arabia. Both caused severe pneumonia killing 774 and 858 people with 8700 cases of confirmed infection for the former, and 2494 for the latter, causing significant economic losses. 8 years later, despite the MERS outbreak remaining in certain parts of the world, at the end of 2019, a new zoonotic coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) and responsible of coronavirus Disease (COVID-19), arose from Wuhan, Hubei Province, China. It spread rapidly and to date has killed 3,242 persons with more than 81,000 cases of infection in China and causing over 126,000 global cases and 5,414 deaths in 166 other countries around the world, especially Italy. SARS-CoV-2 would seem to have come from a bat, but the intermediate reservoir continues to be unknown. Nonetheless, as for SARS-CoV and MERS CoV, the Spillover effect linked to animal-human promiscuity, human activities including deforestation, illegal bush-trafficking and bushmeat, cannot be excluded. Recently, however, evidence of inter-human only transmission of SARS-CoV-2 has been accumulated and thus, the outbreak seems to be spreading by human-to-human transmission throughout a large part of the world.

Here, by developing novel sparse representation of whole-brain fMRI signals and by using the recently publicly released large-scale Human Connectome Project high-quality fMRI data, we show that a number of reproducible and robust functional networks, including both task-evoked and resting state networks, are simultaneously distributed in distant neuroanatomic areas and substantially spatially overlapping with each other, thus forming an initial collection of holistic atlases of functional networks and interactions (HAFNIs). More interestingly, the HAFNIs revealed two distinct patterns of highly overlapped regions and highly specialized regions and exhibited that these two patterns of areas are reciprocally localized, revealing a novel organizational principle of cortical function.'], 'Holistic atlases of functional networks and interactions reveal reciprocal organizational architecture of cortical function.')   \n",

Rats were implanted with CPEs in two nodes of the default mode network (DMN) and two nodes in a lateral cortical network, revealing amperometric oxygen correlation patterns consistent with imaging studies. Using a block design study where rats alternated between sustained periods of instrumental response and unscheduled spontaneous behavior, task-induced decreases in functional connectivity were observed between the DMN node pair, but not in the distinct lateral cortical network, demonstrating network-specific modulation of functional connectivity.'], 'Task-induced modulation of intrinsic functional connectivity networks in the behaving rat.')   \n",

       "4      (['A central feature of theories of spatial navigation involves the representation of spatial relationships between objects in complex environments. The parietal cortex has long been linked to the processing of spatial visual information and recent evidence from single unit recording in rodents suggests a role for this region in encoding egocentric and world-centered frames. The rat parietal cortex can be subdivided into four distinct rostral-caudal and medial-lateral regions, which includes a zone previously characterized as secondary visual cortex. At present, very little is known regarding the relative connectivity of these parietal subdivisions. Thus, we set out to map the connectivity of the entire anterior-posterior and medial-lateral span of this region. To do this we used anterograde and retrograde tracers in conjunction with open source neuronal segmentation and tracer detection tools to generate whole brain connectivity maps of parietal inputs and outputs. Our present results show that inputs to the parietal cortex varied significantly along the medial-lateral, but not the rostral-caudal axis. Specifically, retrosplenial connectivity is greater medially, but connectivity with visual cortex, though generally sparse, is more significant laterally. Finally, based on connection density, the connectivity between parietal cortex and hippocampus is indirect and likely achieved largely via dysgranular retrosplenial cortex. Thus, similar to primates, the parietal cortex of rats exhibits a difference in connectivity along the medial-lateral axis, which may represent functionally distinct areas.'], 'Cortical connectivity maps reveal anatomically distinct areas in the parietal cortex of the rat.')   \n",

       "2      ([\"Early exposure to radiological cross-section images during introductory anatomy and dissection courses increases students' understanding of both anatomy and radiology. Novel technologies such as augmented reality (AR) offer unique advantages for an interactive and hands-on integration with the student at the center of the learning experience. In this article, the benefits of a previously proposed AR Magic Mirror system are compared to the Anatomage, a virtual dissection table as a system for combined anatomy and radiology teaching during a two-semester gross anatomy course with 749 first-year medical students, as well as a follow-up elective course with 72 students. During the former, students worked with both systems in dedicated tutorial sessions which accompanied the anatomy lectures and provided survey-based feedback. In the elective course, participants were assigned to three groups and underwent a self-directed learning session using either Anatomage, Magic Mirror, or traditional radiology atlases. A pre- and posttest design with multiple choice questions revealed significant improvements in test scores between the two tests for both the Magic Mirror and the group using radiology atlases, while no significant differences in test scores were recorded for the Anatomage group. Furthermore, especially students with low mental rotation test (MRT) scores benefited from the Magic Mirror and Anatomage and achieved significantly higher posttest scores compared to students with a low MRT score in the theory group. Overall, the results provide supporting evidence that the Magic Mirror system achieves comparable results in terms of learning outcome to established anatomy learning tools such as Anatomage and radiology atlases.\"], 'The Benefits of an Augmented Reality Magic Mirror System for Integrated Radiology Teaching in Gross Anatomy.')   \n",

Invasive systems achieve a high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) by eliminating the volume conduction problems caused by tissue and bone. An implantable brain machine interface (BMI) using intracortical electrodes provides excellent detection of a broad range of frequency oscillatory activities through the placement of a sensor in direct contact with cortex. This paper introduces a compact-sized implantable wireless 32-channel bidirectional brain machine interface (BBMI) to be used with freely-moving primates. The system is designed to monitor brain sensorimotor rhythms and present current stimuli with a configurable duration, frequency and amplitude in real time to the brain based on the brain activity report. The battery is charged via a novel ultrasonic wireless power delivery module developed for efficient delivery of power into a deeply-implanted system. The system was successfully tested through bench tests and in vivo tests on a behaving primate to record the local field potential (LFP) oscillation and stimulate the target area at the same time.'], 'A Wireless 32-Channel Implantable Bidirectional Brain Machine Interface.')   \n",
       "1      (['Independent component analysis (ICA) as a promising spatial filtering method can separate motor-related independent components (MRICs) from the multichannel electroencephalogram (EEG) signals. However, the unpredictable burst interferences may significantly degrade the performance of ICA-based brain-computer interface (BCI) system. In this study, we proposed a new algorithm frame to address this issue by combining the single-trial-based ICA filter with zero-training classifier. We developed a two-round data selection method to identify automatically the badly corrupted EEG trials in the training set. The \"high quality\" training trials were utilized to optimize the ICA filter. In addition, we proposed an accuracy-matrix method to locate the artifact data segments within a single trial and investigated which types of artifacts can influence the performance of the ICA-based MIBCIs. Twenty-six EEG datasets of three-class motor imagery were used to validate the proposed methods, and the classification accuracies were compared with that obtained by frequently used common spatial pattern (CSP) spatial filtering algorithm. The experimental results demonstrated that the proposed optimizing strategy could effectively improve the stability, practicality and classification performance of ICA-based MIBCI. The study revealed that rational use of ICA method may be crucial in building a practical ICA-based MIBCI system.'], 'A Fully Automated Trial Selection Method for Optimization of Motor Imagery Based Brain-Computer Interface.')   \n",

Patients diagnosed as in a vegetative state lack awareness, while patients diagnosed as in a minimally conscious state retain fluctuating awareness. However, it is a challenge to accurately diagnose these disorders with clinical assessments of behavior. To improve diagnostic accuracy, neuroimaging-based approaches have been developed to detect the presence or absence of awareness in patients who lack overt responsiveness. For the small subset of patients who retain awareness, brain-computer interfaces could serve as tools for communication and environmental control. Here we review the existing literature concerning the sensory and cognitive abilities of patients with disorders of consciousness with respect to existing brain-computer interface designs.

The surface of GCE was functionalized with graphene by incubating it with graphene dispersed in 3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane (APTES), which acted both as a dispersion agent for graphene and as an amine surface modification agent for GCE and graphene. This was followed by the covalent binding of GOx to graphene-functionalized GCE using 1-ethyl-3-[3-dimethylaminopropyl]carbodiimide hydrochloride (EDC) based crosslinking. Graphene provided signal enhancement by providing greater surface area for GOx binding, while APTES-functionalization led to a higher GOx immobilization density by providing free amino groups for crosslinking. The developed biosensor used a redox potential of -0.45 V (vs. Ag/AgCl) for detecting glucose in the diabetic pathophysiological range 0.5-32 mM. There was no interference from endogenous electroactive substances and drug metabolites. The developed biosensor was further validated for detecting blood glucose in commercial artificial blood glucose linearity standards in the range 1.4-27.9 mM. Therefore, it is ideal for diabetic blood glucose monitoring. The developed bioanalytical procedure for preparation of GOx-bound graphene-functionalized GCEs had high production reproducibility and high storage stability, which is appropriate for the commercial mass production of enzyme-bound electrodes.'], 'Mediatorless amperometric glucose biosensing using 3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane-functionalized graphene.')   \n",

Here, we report the integrative assembly of chemically modified graphene (CMG) building blocks into hierarchical complex structures with the hybrid composition for high performance flexible pseudocapacitors. The formation mechanism of hierarchical CMG/Nafion/RuO2 (CMGNR) microspheres, which is triggered by the cooperative interplay during the in situ synthesis of RuO2 nanoparticles (NPs), was extensively investigated. In particular, the hierarchical CMGNR microspheres consisting of the aggregates of CMG/Nafion (CMGN) nanosheets and RuO2 NPs provided large surface area and facile ion accessibility to storage sites, while the interconnected nanosheets offered continuous electron pathways and mechanical integrity. The synergistic effect of CMGNR hybrids on the supercapacitor (SC) performance was derived from the hybrid composition of pseudocapacitive RuO2 NPs with the conductive CMGNs as well as from structural features. Consequently, the CMGNR-SCs showed a specific capacitance as high as 160 F g(-1), three-fold higher than that of conventional graphene SCs, and a capacitance retention of >95% of the maximum value even after severe bending and 1000 charge-discharge tests due to the structural and compositional features.'], 'Electroactive nanoparticle directed assembly of functionalized graphene nanosheets into hierarchical structures with hybrid compositions for flexible supercapacitors.')   \n",

Voltammetry and fluorescence spectroscopy were used to obtain the analytical profiles from different reactant mixtures as a function of concentration. This enabled the extraction of the equilibrium constants (K(SV)) which are reported for the first time. Voltammetric results supported the formation of the LD-BSA complex but not that with dopamine. Further information of the LD-BSA system was unattainable because the measured composite profiles could not be extracted. New information was obtained when the extended data matrix was resolved by the MCR-ALS method. The previously unavailable extracted voltammogram profile of LD-BSA complex indicated that the complex was electroactive; this was unexpected if the LD-BSA system was in its folded state, and hence, it was suggested that the protein must be unfolded. The observation that the drug:BSA stoichiometry was 3:1, i.e. (levodopa)(3)-BSA, supported this suggestion; these results were obtained from the MCR-ALS extracted concentration profiles for the three reaction components.'], 'Combined voltammetric and spectroscopic analysis of small molecule-biopolymer interactions: the levodopa and serum albumin system.')   \n",

Atomic force microscopy (AFM) imaging showed significant reduction of biofilm growth on PVK-SWNT coated surfaces.

Here, we developed this technique to build up multilayers of functionalized carbon nanotubes on the basis of both intermolecular electrostatic and coordinative interactions. Positively charged electroactive viologenthiol (VSH) was first immobilized on multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWNTs) to form MWNT-VSH hybrids with a relative content of ∼9% by weight. Field emission transmission electron microscopy images revealed that the VSH molecules randomly covered the surfaces of MWNTs with a thickness of 1 to 2 nm. Then, the MWNT-VSH hybrids were used as nanoscale multidentate \"ligands\" (linkers) to construct metal-mediated multilayers with the use of CuAc(2) as the connectors by the layer-by-layer (LBL) method. The assembly process was monitored by absorption and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy as well as scanning electron and atomic force microscopy after each assembly of Cu(II) ions and MWNT-VSH hybrids. Finally, the electrochemical behaviors of the viologens in the MWNT-VS/Cu LBL multilayers were investigated.'], 'Copper(II)-mediated layer-by-layer assembly of viologenthiol-functionalized carbon nanotube hybrid multilayers: preparation, characterization, morphology, and electrochemical properties.')   \n",

To minimize tissue damage while retaining high sensitivity, a flexible and a smaller electrode with low impedance is required. However, it is a major challenge to reduce electrode size while retaining the conductive characteristics of the electrode. In addition, the mechanical mismatch between stiff electrodes and soft tissues creates damaging reactive tissue responses. Here, we demonstrate a neural probe structure based on graphene, ZnO nanowires, and conducting polymer that provides flexibility and low impedance performance. A hybrid Au and graphene structure was utilized to achieve both flexibility and good conductivity. Using ZnO nanowires to increase the effective surface area drastically decreased the impedance value and enhanced the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR).

The detailed capture/release behavior of the circulating tumor cells was studied using an organic bioelectronic platform comprising PEO/PEDOT:PSS nanofiber mats with 3 wt % (3-glycidyloxypropyl)trimethoxysilane as an additive. We have demonstrated that these nanofiber mats deposited on five-patterned indium tin oxide finger electrodes are excellent candidates for use as functional bioelectronic interfaces for the isolation, detection, sequential collection, and enrichment of rare CTCs through electrical activation of each single electrode. This combination behaved as an ideal model system displaying a high cell-capture yield for antibody-positive cells while resisting the adhesion of antibody-negative cells. Taking advantage of the electrochemical doping/dedoping characteristics of PEDOT:PSS materials, the captured rare cells could be electrically triggered release through the desorption phenomena of PLL-g-PEG-biotin on device surface. More than 90% of the targeted cancer cells were captured on the 3D PEDOT-based nanofiber microfluidic device; over 87% of captured cancer cells were subsequently released for collection; approximately 80% of spiked cancer cells could be collected in a 96-well plate.

The MOF-525 serves as an electrocatalytic surface, while the PEDOT NTs act as a charge collector to rapidly transport the electron from MOF nanocrystals. Bundles of these particles form a conductive interpenetrating network film that together: (i) improves charge transport pathways between the MOF-525 regions and (ii) increases the electrochemical active sites of the film. The electrocatalytic response is measured by cyclic voltammetry and differential pulse voltammetry techniques, where the linear concentration range of DA detection is estimated to be 2 × 10-6-270 × 10-6 m and the detection limit is estimated to be 0.04 × 10-6 m with high selectivity toward DA. Additionally, a real-time determination of DA released from living rat pheochromocytoma cells is realized.

Beyond homeostatic regulation and sensing, recent neuroscience research has started to shed light on brain-heart interactions in diverse cognitive and emotional processes. In particular, neural responses to heartbeats, as measured with the so-called heartbeat-evoked potential, have been shown to be useful for investigating cortical activity processing cardiac signals. In this review, we first overview and discuss the basic properties of the HEP such as underlying physiological pathways, brain regions, and neural mechanisms. We then provide a systematic review of the mental processes associated with cortical HEP activations, notably heartbeat perception, emotional feelings, perceptual awareness, and self-consciousness, in healthy subjects and clinical populations. Finally, we discuss methodological issues regarding the experimental design and data analysis for separating genuine HEP components from physiological artifacts (e.g., cardiac field artifact, pulse artifact) or other neural activities that are not specifically associated with the heartbeat. Findings from this review suggest that when intrinsic limitations (e.g., artifacts) are carefully controlled, the HEP could provide a reliable neural measure for investigating brain-viscera interactions in diverse mental processes.'], 'Heartbeat-evoked cortical responses: Underlying mechanisms, functional roles, and methodological considerations.')   \n",

The APO was setup either to assist volunteers at the hip levels during balance loss or to be transparent. The Planar Covariation Law (PCL) of the lower limb elevation angles was the main tool used to assess the intersegmental coordination of both limbs (i.e., the perturbed and unperturbed ones). Results revealed that, after the onset of the perturbation, elevation angles of both limbs do not covary, a part from the robot-mediated assistance.

       "3      (['Our brain has developed a specific system to represent the space closely surrounding the body, termed peripersonal space (PPS). This space has a key functional role as it is where all physical interactions with objects in the environment occur. Here I describe how multisensory neurons in a specific fronto-parietal network map the PPS by integrating tactile stimuli on the body with visual or auditory information related to external objects specifically when they are close to the body. I show how PPS representation is not only multisensory, but actually multisensory-motor, as the PPS system interacts with motor areas to trigger appropriate responses. The extent of PPS is not fixed, but it is shaped by experience, as PPS may encompass farther portions of space, once the individual has interacted with them, (e.g., with tools), or it contracts, if interactions are limited because of external constraints, body, or brain injury. Interactions between the individual and the environment are not only physical but may also be \"abstract\". Recent data show that PPS adapts as a consequence of technology-mediated or social interactions. Finally, I propose that besides low-level sensory-motor representations of the space around the different parts of the body, mediating body-objects interactions, the multisensory PPS system also underlies a general representation of the self as distinct from the environment and the others. PPS thus supports self-location, contributes to bodily self-consciousness and mediates higher-level cognitive functions.'], 'Peripersonal space (PPS) as a multisensory interface between the individual and the environment, defining the space of the self.')   \n",

Here, we demonstrate how the intrinsic analogue programmability of memristive devices can be exploited to perform spike-sorting on single devices.

Construction of a low-dimensional model to effectively reduce the dimensionality of the imaging problem has recently shown great promise in improving these tradeoffs. This paper presents a new approach to model and reconstruct the spectroscopic signals by learning a nonlinear low-dimensional representation of the general MR spectra. Specifically, we trained a deep neural network to capture the low-dimensional manifold, where the high-dimensional spectroscopic signals reside. A regularization formulation is proposed to effectively integrate the learned model and physics-based data acquisition model for MRSI reconstruction with the capability to incorporate additional spatiospectral constraints. An efficient numerical algorithm was developed to solve the associated optimization problem involving back-propagating the trained network. Simulation and experimental results were obtained to demonstrate the representation power of the learned model and the ability of the proposed formulation in producing SNR-enhancing reconstruction from the practical MRSI data.'], 'Constrained Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopic Imaging by Learning Nonlinear Low-Dimensional Models.')</td>\n",

Instead of designing a complex network structure, we use domain-specific knowledge to simplify the learning process. In particular, we find that by introducing the mature Gaussian-Laplacian image pyramid decomposition technology to the neural network, the learning problem at each pyramid level is greatly simplified and can be handled by a relatively shallow network with few parameters. We adopt recursive and residual network structures to build the proposed LPNet, which has less than 8K parameters while still achieving the state-of-the-art performance on rain removal.

However, due to the lack of dense annotation of large-scale chest radiograph data, this computer-aided diagnosis task is intrinsically a weakly supervised learning problem and remains challenging. In this paper, we propose a novel deep convolutional neural network called Thorax-Net to diagnose 14 thorax diseases using chest radiography. Thorax-Net consists of a classification branch and an attention branch. The classification branch serves as a uniform feature extraction-classification network to free users from the troublesome hand-crafted feature extraction and classifier construction. The attention branch exploits the correlation between class labels and the locations of pathological abnormalities via analyzing the feature maps learned by the classification branch. Feeding a chest radiograph to the trained Thorax-Net, a diagnosis is obtained by averaging and binarizing the outputs of two branches. The proposed Thorax-Net model has been evaluated against three state-of-the-art deep learning models using the patientwise official split of the ChestX-ray14 dataset and against other five deep learning models using the imagewise random data split. Our results show that Thorax-Net achieves an average per-class area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.7876 and 0.896 in both experiments, respectively, which are higher than the AUC values obtained by other deep models when they were all trained with no external data.'], 'Thorax-Net: An Attention Regularized Deep Neural Network for Classification of Thoracic Diseases on Chest Radiography.')</td>\n",

Selection of the best drug(s) for a patient typically requires the integration of patient data, such as genetics or proteomics, with drug data, like compound chemical descriptors, to score the therapeutic efficacy of drugs. The prediction of drug interactions often relies on similarity metrics, assuming that drugs with similar structures or targets will have comparable behavior or may interfere with each other.

This important role has recently been extended, first to other forms of vocal learning in animals and then also to other forms of motor learning. The homology in structure and in function among the FoxP gene members raises the possibility that the ancestral FoxP gene may have evolved as a crucial component of the neural circuitry mediating motor learning. Here we report that genetic manipulations of the single Drosophila orthologue, dFoxP, disrupt operant self-learning, a form of motor learning sharing several conceptually analogous features with language acquisition. Structural alterations of the dFoxP locus uncovered the role of dFoxP in operant self-learning and habit formation, as well as the dispensability of dFoxP for operant world-learning, in which no motor learning occurs. These manipulations also led to subtle alterations in the brain anatomy, including a reduced volume of the optic glomeruli. RNAi-mediated interference with dFoxP expression levels copied the behavioral phenotype of the mutant flies, even in the absence of mRNA degradation. Our results provide evidence that motor learning and language acquisition share a common ancestral trait still present in extant invertebrates, manifest in operant self-learning.

Eyeblink conditioning has been used for decades a model system for elucidating cerebellar learning mechanisms. The standard model of the mechanisms underlying eyeblink conditioning is that there two synaptic plasticity processes within the cerebellum that are necessary for acquisition of the conditioned response: (1) long-term depression (LTD) at parallel fiber-Purkinje cell synapses and (2) long-term potentiation (LTP) at mossy fiber-interpositus nucleus synapses. Additional Purkinje cell plasticity mechanisms may also contribute to eyeblink conditioning including LTP, excitability, and entrainment of deep nucleus activity. Recent analyses of the sensory input pathways necessary for eyeblink conditioning indicate that the cerebellum regulates its inputs to facilitate learning and maintain plasticity. Cerebellar learning during eyeblink conditioning is therefore a dynamic interactive process which maximizes responding to significant stimuli and suppresses responding to irrelevant or redundant stimuli.

Glutathione level and glutathione dependent free radicals scavenging enzyme system, ATP, NADPH level, γ-glutamylcysteinyl ligase (GCLC) activity and oxidative stress markers were assessed in the hippocampus. Expression of apoptotic marker caspase 3 in hippocampus was investigated by immunohistochemistry. Transcriptional alteration and expression of GCLC and Nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-related factor 2 (Nrf2) were investigated by real time PCR and immunoblotting respectively. Exposure to hypobaric hypoxia decreased reduced glutathione (GSH) level and impaired reduced gluatathione dependent free radical scavenging system in hippocampus resulting in elevated oxidative stress. Supplementation of withanolide A during hypoxic exposure increased GSH level, augmented GSH dependent free radicals scavenging system and decreased the number of caspase and hoescht positive cells in hippocampus. While withanolide A reversed hypoxia mediated neurodegeneration, administration of buthionine sulfoximine along with withanolide A blunted its neuroprotective effects. Exogenous administration of corticosterone suppressed Nrf2 and GCLC expression whereas inhibition of corticosterone synthesis upregulated Nrf2 as well as GCLC. Thus present study infers that withanolide A reduces neurodegeneration by restoring hypoxia induced glutathione depletion in hippocampus.

Interestingly, the stimulation group showed an equivalent performance to the normal group on all measures. And these are partially reversed by the electrode implantation.

Construction of a low-dimensional model to effectively reduce the dimensionality of the imaging problem has recently shown great promise in improving these tradeoffs. This paper presents a new approach to model and reconstruct the spectroscopic signals by learning a nonlinear low-dimensional representation of the general MR spectra. Specifically, we trained a deep neural network to capture the low-dimensional manifold, where the high-dimensional spectroscopic signals reside. A regularization formulation is proposed to effectively integrate the learned model and physics-based data acquisition model for MRSI reconstruction with the capability to incorporate additional spatiospectral constraints. An efficient numerical algorithm was developed to solve the associated optimization problem involving back-propagating the trained network. Simulation and experimental results were obtained to demonstrate the representation power of the learned model and the ability of the proposed formulation in producing SNR-enhancing reconstruction from the practical MRSI data.'], 'Constrained Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopic Imaging by Learning Nonlinear Low-Dimensional Models.')   \n",

This limits their potential applications, e.g., in mobile devices. In this paper, we propose a lightweight pyramid networt (LPNet) for single-image deraining. Instead of designing a complex network structure, we use domain-specific knowledge to simplify the learning process. In particular, we find that by introducing the mature Gaussian-Laplacian image pyramid decomposition technology to the neural network, the learning problem at each pyramid level is greatly simplified and can be handled by a relatively shallow network with few parameters. We adopt recursive and residual network structures to build the proposed LPNet, which has less than 8K parameters while still achieving the state-of-the-art performance on rain removal. We also discuss the potential value of LPNet for other low- and high-level vision tasks.'], 'Lightweight Pyramid Networks for Image Deraining.')   \n",

However, due to the lack of dense annotation of large-scale chest radiograph data, this computer-aided diagnosis task is intrinsically a weakly supervised learning problem and remains challenging. In this paper, we propose a novel deep convolutional neural network called Thorax-Net to diagnose 14 thorax diseases using chest radiography. Thorax-Net consists of a classification branch and an attention branch. The classification branch serves as a uniform feature extraction-classification network to free users from the troublesome hand-crafted feature extraction and classifier construction. The attention branch exploits the correlation between class labels and the locations of pathological abnormalities via analyzing the feature maps learned by the classification branch. Feeding a chest radiograph to the trained Thorax-Net, a diagnosis is obtained by averaging and binarizing the outputs of two branches. The proposed Thorax-Net model has been evaluated against three state-of-the-art deep learning models using the patientwise official split of the ChestX-ray14 dataset and against other five deep learning models using the imagewise random data split. Our results show that Thorax-Net achieves an average per-class area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.7876 and 0.896 in both experiments, respectively, which are higher than the AUC values obtained by other deep models when they were all trained with no external data.'], 'Thorax-Net: An Attention Regularized Deep Neural Network for Classification of Thoracic Diseases on Chest Radiography.')   \n",

The prediction of drug interactions often relies on similarity metrics, assuming that drugs with similar structures or targets will have comparable behavior or may interfere with each other.

This important role has recently been extended, first to other forms of vocal learning in animals and then also to other forms of motor learning. The homology in structure and in function among the FoxP gene members raises the possibility that the ancestral FoxP gene may have evolved as a crucial component of the neural circuitry mediating motor learning. Here we report that genetic manipulations of the single Drosophila orthologue, dFoxP, disrupt operant self-learning, a form of motor learning sharing several conceptually analogous features with language acquisition. Structural alterations of the dFoxP locus uncovered the role of dFoxP in operant self-learning and habit formation, as well as the dispensability of dFoxP for operant world-learning, in which no motor learning occurs. These manipulations also led to subtle alterations in the brain anatomy, including a reduced volume of the optic glomeruli. RNAi-mediated interference with dFoxP expression levels copied the behavioral phenotype of the mutant flies, even in the absence of mRNA degradation. Our results provide evidence that motor learning and language acquisition share a common ancestral trait still present in extant invertebrates, manifest in operant self-learning. This 'deep' homology probably traces back to before the split between vertebrate and invertebrate animals.\"], 'Drosophila FoxP mutants are deficient in operant self-learning.')   \n",

Eyeblink conditioning has been used for decades a model system for elucidating cerebellar learning mechanisms. The standard model of the mechanisms underlying eyeblink conditioning is that there two synaptic plasticity processes within the cerebellum that are necessary for acquisition of the conditioned response: (1) long-term depression (LTD) at parallel fiber-Purkinje cell synapses and (2) long-term potentiation (LTP) at mossy fiber-interpositus nucleus synapses. Additional Purkinje cell plasticity mechanisms may also contribute to eyeblink conditioning including LTP, excitability, and entrainment of deep nucleus activity. Recent analyses of the sensory input pathways necessary for eyeblink conditioning indicate that the cerebellum regulates its inputs to facilitate learning and maintain plasticity. Cerebellar learning during eyeblink conditioning is therefore a dynamic interactive process which maximizes responding to significant stimuli and suppresses responding to irrelevant or redundant stimuli.

Present study explores the ameliorative effect of withanolide A, a major component of withania root extract and its molecular mechanism against hypoxia induced memory impairment. Withanolide A was administered to male Sprague Dawley rats before a period of 21 days pre-exposure and during 07 days of exposure to a simulated altitude of 25,000 ft. Glutathione level and glutathione dependent free radicals scavenging enzyme system, ATP, NADPH level, γ-glutamylcysteinyl ligase (GCLC) activity and oxidative stress markers were assessed in the hippocampus. Expression of apoptotic marker caspase 3 in hippocampus was investigated by immunohistochemistry. Transcriptional alteration and expression of GCLC and Nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-related factor 2 (Nrf2) were investigated by real time PCR and immunoblotting respectively. Exposure to hypobaric hypoxia decreased reduced glutathione (GSH) level and impaired reduced gluatathione dependent free radical scavenging system in hippocampus resulting in elevated oxidative stress. Supplementation of withanolide A during hypoxic exposure increased GSH level, augmented GSH dependent free radicals scavenging system and decreased the number of caspase and hoescht positive cells in hippocampus. While withanolide A reversed hypoxia mediated neurodegeneration, administration of buthionine sulfoximine along with withanolide A blunted its neuroprotective effects. Exogenous administration of corticosterone suppressed Nrf2 and GCLC expression whereas inhibition of corticosterone synthesis upregulated Nrf2 as well as GCLC. Thus present study infers that withanolide A reduces neurodegeneration by restoring hypoxia induced glutathione depletion in hippocampus. Further, Withanolide A increases glutathione biosynthesis in neuronal cells by upregulating GCLC level through Nrf2 pathway in a corticosterone dependenet manner.'], 'Withanolide A prevents neurodegeneration by modulating hippocampal glutathione biosynthesis during hypoxia.')   \n",

To provide evidence for the effectiveness of DBS as a treatment for dementia, we performed DBS in a rat model of dementia with intracerebroventricular administration of 192\\u2009IgG-saporins. We utilized four groups of rats, group 1, unlesioned control; group 2, cholinergic lesion; group 3, cholinergic lesion plus medial septum (MS) electrode implantation (sham stimulation); group 4, cholinergic lesions plus MS electrode implantation and stimulation. During the probe test in the water maze, performance of the lesion group decreased for measures of time spent and the number of swim crossings over the previous platform location. Interestingly, the stimulation group showed an equivalent performance to the normal group on all measures. And these are partially reversed by the electrode implantation. Acetylcholinesterase activity in the hippocampus was decreased in lesion and implantation groups, whereas activity in the stimulation group was not different from the normal group. Hippocampal neurogenesis was increased in the stimulation group. Our results revealed that DBS of MS restores spatial memory after damage to cholinergic neurons.
